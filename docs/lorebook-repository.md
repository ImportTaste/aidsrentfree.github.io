# /aids/ Lorebook Repository

~~That's right, another fucking rentry~~

As it stands, Sigurd knows relatively little about established franchises, so creating lorebook entries for the characters you'd like to include is more often than not necessary. In this rentry, we record notable ones people have made, not only in the general, but also in discord. There may be one not here that would cover a franchise you are interested in — please consider contributing.

## [*Beserk: Golden Age*](https://files.catbox.moe/bgo9mi.lorebook)

![The Best Arc](https://files.catbox.moe/fbpk1o.jpg)

>*I am proud to present the very first Lorebook I share on these threads: a Berserk Lorebook for stories set during the Golden Age arc. Fight the Hundred-Year-War alongside the Band of the Hawk, go on raping sprees with Wyald, have the AI generate accurately retarded names for Tudor knight orders and relive Griffith's ascension and fall from grace with this 44-entries Lorebook.*
>
>*All feedback is welcome: I'll modify it if needed.*

## [*Transformers Beast Wars*](https://files.catbox.moe/m2zxa3.lorebook)

![](https://files.catbox.moe/nawqtc.jpg)

>*I made a Transformers: Beast Wars lorebook. Mostly to get a feel of how making lorebooks works, but also because I'm cringe and liked Dinobot because he's a Shakespeare-quoting velociraptor warrior with laser eyes.*
>
>*Upon testing, training data apparently includes enough Transformers that NAI keeps spitting out things from the other canons, so it might be iffy at times, and works best if you know enough about Beast Wars to keep it on track yourself. Or don't, whatever. Nudge repetition penalties down a bit or it mangles the character names.*
>
>*I have no clue why anyone would want this but it exists now so here it is. Oriented for gen stories, but if you really wanted to fuck a robot T-Rex or spider-lady, you could probably do it.*

## [*Undertale*](https://files.catbox.moe/knyrhh.lorebook)

>*"Okay, so, here is an Undertale lorebook I made using articles from it's main wiki. It uses the scaffold format. Hope you guys enjoy it."*

## [*Muv Luv*](https://rentry.co/MuvLuvLorebook)

![](https://files.catbox.moe/2tgf0a.png)

>*"I finished my Muv-Luv lorebook. This one is based on the "Final Extra" universe in Alternative's Epilogue and Altered Fable (with the exception of male Mikoto, but changing three pronouns will give you his female version). This one goes out to the guy who wanted to fuck the Mitsurugi twins."*

## *[Shin Megami Tensei](https://rentry.co/megatenLorebook)*

 ![The image he posted](https://files.catbox.moe/z3f0jq.jpg)

>*"The newest iteration of the Megami Tensei lorebook is here. In addition to demons from Nocturne and Strange Journey, it now also includes demons from SMT IV and IV Apocalypse, giving it a hefty 570+ entries. Thanks to the new Lorebook changes, generation no longer lags despite that. Since I have a lengthy list of infos and changes/additions, I made a rentry."*

## *[Monster Girl Encyclopedia](https://files.catbox.moe/9rl5tz.lorebook)*

![Another image, I really don't know much about MGE so I hope this is relevant](https://files.catbox.moe/d54l74.jpg)

>*"Went through the monstergirl WI and updated the keys for NAI. Ended up replacing most of them with regex, some of them benefiting from it more than others. For instance, catgirl, cat girl and cat-girl will all trigger the werecat entry now. Japanese names should account for all romanization styles (yoko, youko, yōko). And plurals should work for everything.*
>
>*Also, I removed all the brackets from the descriptions, since they seemed completely arbitrary and only served to make the entries annoying to read. I'm guessing it was some formatfag placebo bullshit that no one will miss.*
>
>*Next step is to figure out how to make the AI bring up various types of monstergirls on its own. Nearly all of these entries will never be brought up unless you prompt the AI somehow. Just making a lorebook entry with a list of all monstergirls would probably take up a third of the context, and it's hard for the AI to figure out what to do with that much unorganized information. Leaning towards making separate entries for different types of areas, like forests, mountains, etc, but it seems like a lot of effort, so I'm very open to better ideas."*

## *[Shinto Lore](https://files.catbox.moe/ss3izj.lorebook)*

![Some image I found](https://files.catbox.moe/si1ujt.jpg)

>*"After Months of research i started a Shinto Lore book. it is accurate to the actual mythology.*
>
>*I will add more Yokai, Chants, Spell, and other supernatural entities and phenomena that are accurate to shinto scripture.*
>
>*If you make a scenario using this LB I would love a tag and see what you come up with.*
>
>*Soon i will add some clans of the period, i will add them on geographical order starting with the Shimazu in the south and working my way up.*
>
>*If you see any mistakes in the history or Shinto lore please let me know.*
>
>*P.s. also feel free to grammar Nazie the shit out of it. Cos AI can freak out with a spelling mistake. XD"*

>*For those just finding out about this: This is a cleanup and rework of LOLarious' Touhou Adventures from AIDungeon, based on a backup provided by Ralle. It aims for high canon accuracy (with enrichment for the most sidelined characters based on general fanon assumptions), and is written in mostly clean prose with a few removed grammatical words.*

## [*My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic*](https://files.catbox.moe/jvsovi.lorebook)

![Isn't this show over?](https://files.catbox.moe/yvafg8.png)

>*"Hi all. Here is a work in progress Lore book for the Mlp G4 world. I have tried to make it canon for about 99% of stuff, the only thing that's not is some stuff on changelings, stuff like their life cycle that was never really explained and with that I just added some bug-ish stuff that I thought made sense, if you don't like it, it's all tagged Changeling so it will be easy to edit. As I said this is still work in progress, in the end I am hoping to add most characters from the show (that actually show up more then once in the background at least) and the more notable locations. From the little testing I've done it works but this is the first large scale lore book I've done so if there is a way to make it work better please let me know."*
