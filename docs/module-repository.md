# The Rent-Free Module Repository
{: .center}

Well, looks like we've run out of space on the [rentry](https://rentry.co/modules).
{: .center}

Thus the repo continues here, where character limit concerns are a thing of the ~~past~~ distant future. If and when another model comes out, I'll backup this edition to it's own page and start from the rentry.co anew.

##### [Charles Dickens](https://files.catbox.moe/pq9lqe.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/347254891/#347266948)

*Trained off the text of Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Carol", "A Tale of Two Cities", "Great Expectations", "Little Doritt", and "Oliver Twist"*

##### [C. S. Lewis](https://mega.nz/file/ESB0VJ6Z#Y31SF_GG4VefJXSmFNBs3WgB0yEGTAQ8S-kPeS43W8M)

[10K Step Vers.](https://mega.nz/file/9W4EVD7Y#zlX2DM6Ypf-QHYet2JoUeUJ7neLeVdniseEYxvSo48c)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/345503749/#345504083)

*My CS Lewis module is complete.*

*Training data was all of the major fiction works:*

- *Narnia (7 books)*
- *Space Trilogy (3 books)*
- *The Screwtape Letters*
- *The Great Divorce*
- *Pilgrim's Regress*
- *Til We Have Faces: A Myth Retold*

*Plus a small amount of non-fiction:*

- *Mere Christianity*
- *The Four Loves*
- *The Weight of Glory*

*I had about 2000 steps left over that I could have used to include more of his non-fiction books, but I was concerned that including too much of it would drown out the fiction in terms of effect on the AI's output. I might try a fiction-only version next month when my steps reset.*
*The results seem pretty great so far, better than I expected. Let me know how you get on with it.*

##### [Franz Kafka](https://files.catbox.moe/6gwcym.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/345503749/#345510501)

*Ever want to lose yourself in a maze of surreal bureaucracies? Now you can with the Kafka module! Trained off of:*

- *Collected Stories*
- *Amerika*
- *The Trial*
- *The Castle*

##### [George Orwell](https://mega.nz/file/iqI2AJQJ#u-RpEIiP0Mik-9oK9xflq9cq331BBBdEFVMpjljZQwI)

[by](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/347718642/#347813685) [Anons](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/347951663/#347987649)

*Someone suggested to do this as a module. Done.*

##### [Hunter S. Thompson](https://files.catbox.moe/klnhls.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/346069285/#346168134)

*Hunter S. Thompson works. It includes:*

- *Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas*
- *Hell's Angels*
- *Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72*
- *The Rum Diary*
- *The Curse of Lono*
- *Screwjack & Other Stories**

##### [J. R. R. Tolkien](https://files.catbox.moe/8mazpc.module)

[by untouch](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/870472647383867412)

*The full text of The Hobbit, Lord of The Rings and The Silmarillion.*

##### [Jane Austen](https://files.catbox.moe/v8g63f.module)

[by GelatinousLunch](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/879348810550231090)

*A module from all of Jane Austen major novels and the unfinished Sanditon. The first was trained to 100% and the second to 30%, so the former is good for living in the worlds of the novels, a la Lost in Austen, while the latter sticks a little less closely to the characters and locations from the novels.*

*(4.4 mb, ~4000 steps, 100% coverage)*

[30% Trained ver.](https://files.catbox.moe/m77dti.module)

##### [Oscar Wilde](https://files.catbox.moe/ojdf8x.module)

[by Jorgith Blastercrotch](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/871265822704803910)

*Trained on selected works such as The Picture of Dorian Gray, Poems and Poems in Prose*

##### [Rod Serling](https://files.catbox.moe/fktkh3.zip)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/345503749/#345504110)

*The Rod Serling module. Trained on:*

- *Stories from the Twilight Zone*
- *More Stories from the Twilight Zone*
- *New Stories from the Twilight Zone*
- *Night Gallery*
- *Night Gallery 2*

*Those were the only ones I could find easily. I think The Season To Be Wary would've fit in well as well, but I couldn't find it. Maybe that's for V2 of the model, if that will become a thing. Anyway, I decided to include all my files with the module, so you get the original ebooks I used, the original parsing in plaintext that Pandoc made, and my final edited text files that I used for the training. Maybe it's interesting for someone to see how the module was made. Note: I had an ebook that combined the three Twilight Zone books into one, so there's three ebooks in total.*

##### [Shirley Jackson](https://files.catbox.moe/k37k7r.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/348150249/#348193395)

*A collection of horror and mystery novels by Shirley Jackson. 5.1MB 1500 steps, 26.53% coverage*

>\*\*\*
>
>The moment she opened the door to her apartment, a wave of heat and light hit her. The sun was setting behind the building across from hers, but it still managed to illuminate everything inside. She could see every detail in the room: the bare white walls; the kitchen counter with its old-fashioned wooden cabinets; the framed poster on the wall that said "I My Mom." It had been there for as long as she'd lived here—she remembered when she'd gotten it at an art fair downtown. A small smile played over her lips. She loved this place. This neighborhood. And most importantly, she loved her mom.
>
>She walked into the living room and dropped her bag by the couch. Her mother's voice came through the open window.
>
>"You're home!" she yelled out.
>
>Alexandra took off running down the hall.
>
>"Hey, sweetie!"

##### [Stephen King](https://files.catbox.moe/bn2trc.module)

[by guywhoknowsnothing](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/870565908735725591)

*Inspired by the works of author Stephen King.*

##### [Tom Clancy](https://files.catbox.moe/4eeiam.module)

[by guywhoknowsnothing](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/871492756793606184)

*Inspired by the works of author Tom Clancy.*

##### [Vladimir Nabokov](https://files.catbox.moe/o1o8kg.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/345503749/#345507380)

*Updated my Nabokov module to include the rest of his English language novels, except for Pale Fire and Ada or Ardor. Also cleaned it up a bit so some of the wonkiness present in the first version should no longer occur.*

*Here's a module that's trained off of Nabokov using the following, formatted using the training guide:*

- *Lolita*
- *Pnin*
- *Speak, Memory*

*Results seem solid thus far.*

#### [Web Authors](#writers)

##### [Benjamin R. "Yahtzee" Croshaw](https://files.catbox.moe/t8dbtp.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/345615202/#345707116)

*Zero Punctuation module. Trained on (nearly) all of Yahtzee's Zero Punctuation series (at time of training), from The Darkness to Cruelty Squad. ~5.6k steps, 10MB of data. Not pornographic but will probably produce NSFW results [(pic related)](https://files.catbox.moe/ub4194.png)*

##### [Joe Forest](https://www.mediafire.com/file/jfj4hj2bufz219n/Joe+Forest.module/file)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/348541970/#348588994)

*Anyone here into any of the stuff Joe Forest writes? He's the dude that made the SLUT Academy HTML/Twine game if you're familiar with that. It's pretty degenerate shit TF, preg, bestiality, MTF, Even weirder TF like vaginas turning into their canine equivalents, but I figure someone here is as depraved as I am.*

*I trained a Novel AI module with all of his stuff, including his HTML games. Though I left out Lost Property, and his RPGM game.*

*I haven't done much to test if it works all that great or not, but I had the AI write out some terms and character descriptions of things/people that are in the stories to see if it caught on to some of it. For the most part, they seem to be somewhat close to what they are in the stories, with some obvious AI weirdness mixed in. Some of them can be hit or miss though. I think it's dependent on how long a given story is and how much a given term appears in it. So it failed on some obscure ones, but also got some of them pretty close. It's hit or miss.*

*I'm not really sure how well it does at writing smut yet in an actual story, but for what it's worth, I pressed enter on a blank prompt and it went head first into generating a sex scene.*

*I'm new to training the AI though, so I only went for 100% of the training (so about 1500 steps), I don't really know if that's enough or not.*

##### [Prinny](https://files.catbox.moe/d669ox.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/345358791/#345486924)

*This module is based on my [favorite monster/human female unwilling/erotic vore author](https://aryion.com/g4/gallery/PrinnyDood).*

##### [Slutty](https://files.catbox.moe/l97u6x.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/345503749/#345507380)

*Here is my module, based off [SlutWriter's entire catalogue of original works](https://archiveofourown.org/users/SlutWriter/pseuds/SlutWriter/works?fandom_id=2692) and hopefully lending to a more descriptive NSFW writing style.*

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/346359371/#346360287)

*I've trained a module on screenplays for action movies. 1.6 MB, 2000 steps.*

>A huge explosion rocks the streets of Los Angeles. The shock wave ripples outward across the entire city. Buildings topple. Fires rage. Smoke billows high into the air. All over town, windows shatter. Bricks fall from buildings and crash to the pavement below.
>
>The Man watches everything happen. Finally, he begins walking towards the center of the city. It will take time for word of this disaster to spread throughout the region. By then, however, he has already made his way deep inside the heart of downtown L.A.

>"What's that?" Krenshaw asked, but it was too late for her to do anything about it. The thing came out of the darkness like a snake emerging from its hole—and then it struck. It whipped around the woman's head with an explosive hiss, clamped down on her face, and dragged her into the blackness. She screamed once, long and shrill, before she disappeared completely.

*Intended to introduce inspiration by Ancient Rome, this draws from books written by Colleen McCullough and classics such as I, Cladius, with epic battles by legionaries against the barbarians as gladiatorial spectacles. Political intrigue abound!*

>**Rome! The greatest city in the world, and my home.** I would rather die than leave it."
>
>"I understand," said Caesar coldly. "You are a patriot as well as an opportunist; you will not be happy anywhere else. But that is your own affair." He turned to me again. "So we have decided: the three of us shall stay together for one year only. We need time to decide what our next step should be."
>
>"If there were more men like you two around, perhaps Rome could still stand!" Antonia spoke with feeling. She was very beautiful at this moment, her face flushed from wine or excitement, but she looked tired too. Her eyes seemed haunted by some memory, though whether good or bad she did not say.
>We had been talking about politics all evening. It was clear now why Pompey's letter had caused such dismay among his supporters.

*Trained on The Mabinogion, Gawain and the Green Knight, and various other Arthurian stories.*

> Mordred grew up to become a great warrior just like his father before him. His mother never forgot how much she owed to the woman who saved her life. She gave birth to Mordred knowing that she had given him something very special—the gift of magic. He was born able to use powers beyond normal men—powers which allowed him to control animals and spirits. When he reached adulthood he joined the ranks of the Knights of the Round Table. And there he met Elaine of Cornwall—a beautiful young lady whose eyes held him captive. Their love was true and pure. They vowed to spend their lives together.
>
> When they married, they made a vow: Never shall either of us leave the other side of the world. So great was their love for each other that they swore to go together wherever fate might send them. As a token of their promise they took an oath upon themselves. To the end of time, neither of them shall ever break the bond of marriage. If one should die first then the survivor must take the dead spouse's place beside him on the throne of Britain. The two of them spent all of their time together. Even at the risk of their own lives they protected others from harm.
>
> It was at a tournament held near the city of Caerleon in Wales that the two of them came face to face for the first time. There was a fierce battle going on. A man was lying wounded in the middle of the field. The knights of the court gathered around him trying to help.
> "I'm sorry to say," said the man to Mordred. "But I fear I am dying."
>
> "You are not going to die," said Mordred. "I'll save you."
>
> The man looked at Mordred in amazement. "You? You are only a boy! How can you possibly do such a thing?"
>
> "Because I am the king's son," replied Mordred.

>
>The game starts and I see that this time my opponent is Yoshi! He has three lives left so he can't die yet. And his first move was to throw me off balance by throwing fireballs at me from behind.
>
>Now we're both running around the map trying to catch each other up. He's going for the flag, while I'm trying to avoid his attacks. Then he throws another fireball but misses and I manage to grab it and use it to attack back. But then Yoshi comes right out of nowhere with a big jump kick and knocks me into the air!
>
>He catches me and throws me across the screen, knocking me out of bounds. Now I'm on the edge of the map and there are no more flags or items nearby. So now what? It looks like I've lost. But wait... Yoshi has only one life left! If I knock him out here, he dies too.
>
>Yoshi sees this coming and jumps over to where I am lying on the ground. I get ready to knock him away again, when suddenly he turns into a mushroom! Then he flies straight through the wall and disappears. The game ends as soon as Yoshi loses all his lives.
>
>I look up at the clock and see that I just barely beat him in time. Yoshi gets 3 points and I get 5. This makes my total score 30 points.

##### [Aztec, Inca and Mayan Mythology](https://files.catbox.moe/mn2n35.module)

Trained on various texts from Internet Sacred Text Archive (including: The Myths of Mexico and Peru by Lewis Spence, The Hymn of Huitzilopochtli, The Festival of The Sun, and more), and extracts on Aztec gods from Mythopedia.

>The Sun, in his anger at the theft of his sister-wife, struck down her brother with a bolt from his golden bow. The woman was transformed into a serpent and became the goddess Quetzalcoatl.
>
>In another version of this myth she is called Xiuhtlilotli (the daughter of the sun), who went to live among the stars and bore twin sons to Huitzilopochtli: Tonatiuh ("sun") and Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli ("moon"). These were then adopted by their grandfathers, Tezcatlipoca and Omeyocan, and given new names as lords of heaven. They also had two sisters; one became the moon, while the other married Mixcohuatzin and gave birth to Mictlan, the god of death. This legend appears to have been derived from an earlier tale that told how Quetzalcoatl's father, Itzcuauhcihuatl, had been killed by his younger brothers for having stolen fire from them. A later addition described him as 'a son of heaven' rather than of the sun or Venus.
>
>To these myths are added many others concerning the creation of mankind, which may be grouped under three main heads—those relating to the origin of man, those describing his development through ages, and those dealing with the end of all things.

> "Are you sure?"

>
> "Yes," he said again. "I'm sure."
>
> He looked up at her. She was beautiful, so much like his mother that it was almost eerie. But she wasn't his mother. His mother had died when he was young. This woman...this creature...was nothing but a figment of his imagination. A figment of his subconscious. The last remnants of his grief over the loss of his parents.
>
> And yet, even knowing that, he couldn't stop staring at her. Couldn't look away.
>
> She smiled, then, a smile that was as bright and warm as the sun. It was the smile of a woman who knew exactly what she wanted.
>
> "Then let's go home, Bruce," she said. "Let's go home together."

*This module is trained with a focus on battle scenes from fiction set in the BattleTech tabletop universe and the related MechWarrior & MechCommander video games. 2mb, 1000 steps.*

*Always refer to mechs as 'Mechs, and dropships as DropShips etc... for best results.*

*Material curated and formatted in tandem with Human Error.*

*Possible future updates to this module will include more lore and technical fluff text.*

***What to expect from this module:***

- *Epic battles of giant heavily armed and armored walking tanks known as 'Mechs, as well as other vehicles like conventional tanks, spacecrafts, jets, hovercrafts, naval vessels, and also infantry.*
- *Missiles, lasers, ballistic weapons, airstrikes, and bombs.*
- *Galactic scale political intrigue, betrayal, and sabotage.*
- *Paid mercenary forces loyal only to the almighty C-Bill.*
- *Professional bloodsport arena combat between mechs before a spectator audience.*

***What not to expect from this module:***

- *Lore accuracy. Don't hope for it, seriously.*

>"Contact!" A voice shouted over comms. "Two enemy 'Mechs approaching from the south-east quadrant. One hundred meters away."
>
>A chill ran down the spine of every MechWarrior present. That was the direction from which most of the bandits had come, and the only place on the island where 'Mechs would approach without being seen.
>
>"All units, prepare for combat maneuvers. Target priority: Bandits. Repeat, target priority: Bandits."
>
>Taylitha jerked the joystick, and the Atlas lurched forward on its massive legs. She hit the throttle and the 'Mech surged ahead, leaving the other 'Mechs behind it.
>
>"50 meters, 3 o'clock!"
>
>The warning came over the comm, followed by the sound of something tearing into the ground.
>
>"30 meters, 2 o'clock!"
>
>"20, 1 o'clock!"
>
>"10, straight ahead!"
>
>"Fire!"
>
>The battle erupted at once.
>
>"Bandit down," came the call over the comm.
>
>The Atlas slowed down and pulled back slightly so it wouldn't interfere with the others in the fight.
>
>"Enemy 'Mechs engaging the rest of the lance," another voice reported over the comm.
>
>"We're going after the leader," Kasten said.
>
>"Roger," replied the second voice.
>
>"What are your orders?"
>
>"I'll take the right flank. You cover the left," Kasten said.
>
>"Affirmative. I'm on my way."
>
>"Don't kill him unless you have to," Kasten added.
>
>Taylitha centered her reticle over a grouping of UrbanMechs, then mashed the primary firing group trigger, unleashing a barrage of PPC fire. The weapons spat blue lightning from their barrels, carving a path through the cluster of machines.
>
>She moved the crosshairs to the next target and fired again, this time hitting a nearby Clan OmniMech. It staggered backward under the onslaught, then fell.

>Cú Chulainn and his foster-brother Ferdia, who had been brought up together in the same house. But Cú Chulainn was a great man of war; he went out to fight against Conchobar son of Nectan for that reason, because he would not pay him tribute when he asked it:
>
>'I have neither wife nor children,' said Conchobar, 'and I am an old man without wealth or possessions.'
>
>Then they fought one another on the field of battle near Tara. And at first there were many champions on either side with their weapons ready and eager for combat. Then the two men fell into each other's hands, and each took hold of the opposite sword hilt. Each gripped the handle firmly so as to prevent himself from being thrown away by the strength of his adversary. When this happened, both swords broke off short in the middle, but they did not break apart. They stood thus gripping each other's wrists until nightfall. That is why today we call them †Fáel Dé (‡) Fáel Dé( ) and Fáel Dóid ( ).
>
>They stayed till morning and then returned home. The host of Conchobar saw what had occurred between them, and said, 'It seems my kinsman has some special power over yours!' He therefore challenged Cú Chulainn again to single combat. This time he met him outside the city walls where the contest began in earnest. It lasted three days and nights, and Cú Chulainn killed him. So now Conchobar lay dead upon the battlefield.
>
>And then the king sent messengers throughout Ulster asking if any champion could come forward to take revenge for the death of his brother. Thereupon Óenach Maelgha came forward saying, "I will do this."

*Get you leather jackets and shades to step out into the neon-filled sprawls of the near future! Trained on classic cyberpunk work, mostly from the 80s. So expect more of a retro-Cyberpunk experience. The cyberpunk genre is a bit hard to pin down, and I selected broad selection of works. So this might need a bit of handholding at first to produce the themes you are going for. I do not have time to extensively test modules at the moment, so if you end up using this feel free to ping me about your experiences with the module!*

>Ghost walked into Club Penumbra and let the beat fill him. He wished he wasn't hunting business.
>
>The last thing he wanted was to be caught in a firefight, but that's what you got for going after an old man who doesn't want to die yet.
>
>He looked around at the other people dancing or just standing there watching the music play. They were all so young: most of them hadn't even been born when Ghost had started out as a street punk on the West Coast. You could tell they didn't know any better; their clothes weren't too different from those worn by his own generation back then.

*The module can generate pretty amazing Cyberpunk output, but **IMPORTANT: you have to add [ Genre: Cyberpunk ] to the A/N.** There is definitely a huge difference between default and this module, even if you need to add the Genre, I tested it.*

>**Mike arrived at the black market bar** with a bad feeling. The place was called "The Overlook", and it had been a popular meeting spot for local hackers and pirates for years, but lately Mike had noticed that some of its clientele seemed to be showing up with bruises and worse on their faces. He'd tried asking around about it once or twice, but nobody wanted to talk in public. Some people were scared of what might happen if they got involved; others just didn't want to know.
>
>It wasn't hard to find out where the trouble was coming from. It started at the door, as usual. A pair of bouncers, big men with shaved heads and matching tattoos across their cheeks. They stood there like statues, watching the crowd come and go through an eye-slit in the middle of each helmet. No one got past them without being scanned and IDed by a small box on their belt. You could argue about whether this made you safer, or just more visible. If anyone did try anything stupid, the bouncers would take care of it. Nobody argued.
>
>Once inside, Mike found himself facing another set of guards. These ones looked like musclebound cyborgs. Their arms ended in long bionic fingers tipped with vicious spikes. They wore bulky combat armour over which their muscles bulged like thick cables straining against their sleeves.

> **Leaving Neverwinter, the dwarf Magnus Bigpuffer reflected on his journey north, to Luskan.** He had never been there before and he didn't know what to expect when he arrived. The city was notorious for its lack of respect toward dwarves.
> The last time a caravan from Waterdeep had come through town it had brought with it an angry mob that intended to kill all the dark elves living in Luskan. Fortunately, the leader of the caravan had stopped at the gates long enough to explain matters to the guards-and then paid them off handsomely. As a result, no one wanted to start trouble with the merchants or their hired fighters. But every merchant knew that if things went sour between him and the guardhouse, he would be lucky to get out alive.
>
> Still, some people were not satisfied by this arrangement. One particularly large and ugly human named Torgar Skullsplitter seemed determined to make life miserable for everyone who entered the city. His soldiers did nothing but harass travelers, especially those who looked like they might have something worth stealing. And so most traders avoided going into the city altogether.
>
> Magnus wondered how many other cities followed the example set by Luskan: towns where only humans lived? Would any other race ever dare enter such places? Perhaps after years of being treated as second class citizens, the drow felt justified in treating others less favorably than themselves. Or perhaps they simply enjoyed making enemies wherever possible.

>The ground shook with the thunder of cannon fire and explosions. A wall of steel slammed into them as their enemies poured through a breach in the line. They'd managed to hold back most of the enemy forces for now—but they were being pushed back toward the city's main gate.
>
>"We need to fall back!" Alex shouted over his tactical channel. "They're going to overrun us." He saw one of his men go down, then another, and he cursed under his breath. That was it; that was all they could do here. Their remaining squads would be cut off from the rest of the company if they didn't retreat soon.
>
>He pulled up his HUD just long enough to see where everyone else on his team was positioned. MacLachlan was still holding out against an assault by two full companies, but their left flank had been forced back almost half way across the field. Alex saw Corporal Dolan's team fighting desperately to keep the mercenaries at bay, while Captain Strand's people fought to get past them to cover the retreating soldiers. And Sergeant Klinner's team was nowhere to be seen. Had they lost contact? Or had they already fallen? Either way, there wasn't much time left before everything fell apart.
>
>Alex turned his attention back at the big tank. It looked like some kind of giant insect, squatting menacingly atop its massive legs. But instead of mandibles or pincers, this thing held a single large cannon.

>M14's head was spinning. She had been in the thick of it all day, and she felt like a fool for not seeing what everyone else saw - that this whole thing with S7 was nothing more than an elaborate set-up to get her out here where they could finish their work on her. That thought alone made M14 feel sick. The girl was so much weaker now; she wasn't even strong enough to defend herself against the likes of those two girls! And then there was BR55... M14 shuddered at the memory.
>
>She recalled how quickly BR55 had taken advantage of M14 when she'd let down her guard during one of their earlier sparring sessions. How easily she had broken through M14's defenses, hacking into her neural cloud and taking control over her body without any effort or resistance from her. It hadn't even been a fight. All the same, the experience left a bad taste in the doll's mouth.
>
>"It doesn't make sense..." M14 muttered to no-one in particular, the words spilling from her lips as though they came unbidden. "Why would BR55 do that to me? Why risk her own life just to get rid of me?"
>
>The doll's eyes fell upon the gun in her hands. the warped reflection in its polished form seemed to stare right back at the doll and through her face, mocking her.
>
>"I'm the weakest of the lot, and I know it. But still you try to take my life away from me," she said bitterly, a cold chill running down her spine as the voice echoed in her mind.
>
>The doll's grip tightened around the weapon, the metal and plastic digging into the flesh of her fingers.

*Journeys between stars across multiple generations at slower than light! Some are escaping a doomed Earth, others have forgotten that they are generation ships, and further, society breaks down; a few are grand odysseys in the hard scifi tradition.*

>**\*\*\***
>
>**The generation ship Odysseus burned for the stars, its giant fusion torch pushing it as close as possible to lightspeed,** but even at that velocity it would take centuries—centuries of travel time. But in addition to the Odysseus there was a second ship: Hermes II, also carrying colonists from Earth and Luna. The two ships were separated by almost a hundred million kilometers; one could see them only when they passed through each other's shadow or emerged briefly into sunlight on opposite sides of Sol. In those brief moments, though, they both looked like streaks of light against the sky, bright points of light racing toward their destination. And now, after nearly thirty years, the two ships had met again.
>
>"We're going to be talking about this all day," said Hockenberry. "I think." He nodded his head forward, toward the window. They were passing through the shadow of another star now, and he couldn't make out anything more than the vague shapes of the trees outside the car. The world seemed small. It was hard to believe that the world contained so much space between people.

*An updated and refined version of my previous Mad Max module, this should enhance scenarios based on the film series.*

>**The roar of the engine**, the hiss and crackle of a radio transmission. The wind whipped at their faces as they raced down the road in an open-topped jeep.
>
>"It's going to be close," said Max. "They're almost on us." He glanced over his shoulder again. Two cars were coming up behind them. They had turned off onto another dirt track leading toward the same town. There was no way he could lose them now; not with this speed...
>
>Max slowed down slightly. It wasn't enough for him to risk losing control, but it would slow the pursuers down just that little bit more. Just enough time for them to reach the end of the road before they caught up with him.
>
>He pulled into the side of the road, braking hard, skidding around a corner so sharply that gravel flew from beneath the wheels. Then he hit the accelerator again, gunning the engine until he felt the car lurch forward once more. But the two pursuing vehicles were still gaining fast.
>
>And then there was nowhere else to go.

>**High on the walls of the city** he saw a great company of men and women, tall and fair to look upon; but they were clad in black. And some bore long spears with sharp points like needles or swords, while others had bows that bent not only swiftly but far. But there was no sound save their own voices as they sang together:
>
>‘Come ye out from your houses! Come forth into the streets! The day is come for burning all evil things! For we are the servants of Elendil who dwelt here before the beginning of days. We have cleansed this place by fire, so it shall be clean again. All that has been done here since the world began must now be undone. Let those who would live in peace go up into the hills where none will find them. Let those who love war make ready. It is our hour. In darkness let us work deeds of light!’

*Some of the best and most poetic fantasy written went into this module, from Guy Gavriel Kay, Mervyn Peake, Patricia A. McKillip and others. If you want beautiful prose in an almost fairy-tale setting, this is the module for you!*

>**The mermaid sang upon the rocks,** and her voice was like a silver bell. The sun shone down on the sea-green water as it rippled in waves around the rocky islet where she lay. There were no other creatures to be seen, only an occasional gull or seagull; but for these there was nothing remarkable about them at all except that they did not sing. But this one had come out of curiosity, perhaps from some place far away, because it flew slowly round the island and then settled itself on the ledge beside the mermaid's head. She lifted up her long hair which fell over her shoulders into a shining cascade of green seaweed and watched with half-closed eyes while the bird perched contentedly above her. It seemed to her that its feathers glowed with tiny lights of their own, so bright that they made her look again when suddenly, without warning, the bird began to speak: "I am sorry," he said, "but I cannot stay here any longer." He flapped his wings once more and rose higher than ever before. "You are too beautiful!" cried the mermaid sadly. Then she turned back to face the world of men.
>
>"Oh my poor little sister," sighed the dragon who had been watching her all day from the topmost branches of the great tree, "how can you bear such loneliness? How will your heart survive?" His tears came streaming down his huge scaly cheeks, and he wept until he could weep no more. And when the mermaid saw him weeping, she knew how much she loved him, although she had never known love herself. So she called him close to her side and held him tight against her breast. Her arms went around him, and she pressed his head beneath her chin. "Now don't cry anymore," she whispered, "because if you do, I shall die also."
>
>And she told him what had happened since the time when he had gone away. As she spoke, she grew sadder and sadder, and when she finished speaking she sat quite still, gazing silently ahead of her into the distance. The dragon felt her sadness through every scale of his body, and he understood that now she would never return home again. With a sigh he laid himself down across her lap, resting his head between her breasts. They stayed thus together for many hours, neither moving nor saying anything.

>**The ghoul snarled at the New California Republic Ranger, and** then turned his back on her.
>
>"You're a fool," he said to Snowman, in English. "A foolish man." He spat into the snow beside him. Then he kicked it away from himself with one foot. "I have been here before—you cannot see me now because I am invisible!"
>
>Snowman looked around nervously as if afraid that someone else might hear this madman's ravings. The ranger stood very still, watching the ghoul intently. She was not sure what she expected him to do next; perhaps shoot the ghoul dead where he lay or run off screaming in terror of an imaginary monster. But when nothing happened after several long moments, she relaxed slightly. It appeared that the ghoul had no intention of attacking them. Perhaps he had gone insane like so many others who were stranded out there alone, living among the ruins of their world. Maybe he just wanted some company. Or maybe he intended to kill Snowman for food. Either way, the two Rangers would be better off without him.
>
>"What are you doing?" asked Snowman, speaking slowly and carefully, trying hard to keep his voice calm. "Why did you come down here? What is your name?"
>
>"My name is Ghoul," replied the ghoul, turning toward the boy again. "And yours, sir?"
>
>"Ranger Walker," answered the girl. "This is my partner, Ranger Snowman."
>
>"Ah! A woman Ranger. You must make good use of her skills." His eyes glittered ferally as they focused on Snowman. "She can help you find more women to eat."
>
>Walker scowled. This was hardly the time for leering at another human being.

>**The snow** was deep, and the wind howled around them. The horses stumbled along through drifts that reached their chests. It took all of Sergei’s skill to keep his mount from breaking its leg in a hidden hole or slipping on an unseen rock. His breath came out like smoke as he struggled with the reins. He could feel the cold seeping into him. As if it were taking over his body, freezing his bones and heart and lungs until they would no longer obey him.
>
>Ahead, Alexei saw the blackened ruin of what had once been a house. A small village. But there was nothing left now but a few charred timbers sticking up above the snow. Everything else had vanished under the white blanket. And beyond, the forest loomed darkly against the sky. Darker than any night before.
>
>It is coming, thought Sergei. He knew this feeling well. This terror at the sight of something vast and unknowable. Something evil and powerful.
>
>They rode closer, toward the burned-out shell of the house. There were more ruins farther back—the remains of barns and sheds. No people. Only the ashes and broken wood. No bodies anywhere. Not even animals. Just the bitter cold and the silence of death.

> **On a clear day in Gensokyo,** the sun shines over Utsuta Shrine, which has an unusually large red torii gate at its entrance. At night, you can see stars twinkling through gaps between buildings on Hieda Street. There was once an old shrine near here dedicated to Amaterasu Ōmikami (the Goddess who created this world). But now there isn't any sign that anyone worshipped her anymore. For some reason, people living nearby have decided not to worship her either—and they've put up signs saying so all along the road leading into town. This used to make me wonder if maybe she'd gone back home or something...but I guess we don't really know what happens after death? Anyway, since the only things left behind were those signs, most folks just ignore them these days.
> 
> The village itself consists mostly of farmhouses and other small wooden structures. Some houses even look like yurakucho -style homes built without using modern building techniques! Yet despite being relatively close together, none of their roofs ever leak because each house sits atop a stone pillar buried underground. The pillars aren't very wide though, so sometimes kids playing outside get stuck under one. That's why residents pretty much avoid going past the central plaza during festivals, where these giant piles of stones stand sentinel. They're called "stone columns" for obvious reasons. In fact, the whole area around the main roads is known as Stone Pillar District, while everything else is referred to simply as Old Town. It makes sense given how many temples, shrines and family owned businesses exist here, making it feel more like a real city than the neighboring villages.

> **Kaguya and Mokou came flying at each other,** both taking great leaps over trees towards their opponent. The two girls were quite close now as they darted around one another like playful cats or dogs while occasionally giving little pokes from behind. Both made sure not to land any blows on the backside of either girl; for if they did it would be considered an attack against them- which was highly frowned upon by all three fairies. But neither seemed concerned about this rule. They fought hard enough that should have been impossible considering how fast they moved so far apart yet still managed to give occasional punches without landing. It looked more like dancing than actual combat between these two. In fact, I couldn't help but feel that there wasn't much real danger involved here... despite what happened next. Fortunately though, it didn't seem likely that anyone else saw it coming anyway. As soon as the last few sparks flew off into nothingness, however, my suspicions turned to certainty after seeing just who had won this battle: Kaguya! And she hadn't done anything particularly special to win. No spell-casting prowess, no fancy martial arts moves, no superhuman speed or strength. Just a simple trick up her sleeve: immortality.
> 
> At some point during this whole thing (and most certainly before), Kaguya's body was slightly altered through means unknown - possibly due to being exposed to something weirdly powerful, maybe getting hit by lightning again, maybe having magic cast directly onto her? Whatever the case may be, when the dust settled and everything fell quiet once more, Kaguya stood triumphantly atop a small hillock surrounded by several fallen foes. Her victory celebration consisted mostly of laughing loudly whilst throwing dirt everywhere until finally falling asleep beneath a tree.

>**The figure of dark majesty loomed over him, and his heart skipped a beat when she smiled, revealing** the fangs.
>
>"You've done well," said Theodora in her most seductive voice. "I am pleased with your progress." She reached out to touch his face as he gazed up at her, but then withdrew her hand. Instead, she leaned forward and whispered into his ear: "There is more work for you to do before I can bestow upon you my favor." Her breath was hot against his neck; it sent shivers down his spine. He trembled, even though he knew that what he felt could not be real. It had all been an illusion—a dream within a dream—but now it seemed very much like reality indeed.

>She stood back from him, smiling again, although there was no warmth in her expression this time.

> The road had been smooth for most of the day, but now it began to climb steeply into the mountains. The wind picked up speed and strength; clouds scudded across the sky like dark birds flying south. It was a storm coming. Charley knew that much. He could feel it in his bones.
> 
> It was also snowing. A few flakes drifted down from the gray sky, tiny white stars drifting through the air. Charley felt a little better with every step he took. The cold was gone, replaced by an exhilarating sense of freedom. He walked with purpose, not looking back or forward, just walking and breathing.

*As with v1, this module is trained on similar adventure series, literary RPGs, nature books, and other resources that have been 'Pokémonized' to match the names, abilities, rules, and other aspects of the Pokémon universe.*

*Version 2 is better cleaned and pruned with a focus on quality over quantity.*

*I removed the Jim Butcher (Furies of Calderon) books and the Lucy Cooke one as they were too stylistically different even with the changes to names and terms. I also further cleaned up the Djinn Tamer series and some others and tried to better balance out the usage of Pokémon content. The dataset is otherwise the same.*

*As a result, battles (especially tournaments) are a lot more common, as is Pokémon being associated with Pokéballs. I think this version is a lot stronger, and while I'll continue to look for ways to improve upon it, I feel a lot more confident with this than I did with v1. Let me know what you think!*

> It's a little over an hour before the tournament is set to begin. The gym has been cleaned and organized, with tables in place for all of the trainers and a podium ready for any announcements. I'm standing at the front of the room next to Professor Pepper, who's dressed in her usual black lab coat. She looks exhausted, but happy that she got through another day. Her eyes are heavy, like they've seen far too much over the past few days.
>
> I glance around the room as people start trickling in. There are maybe thirty or so trainers here today, which isn't surprising considering how many were in the last group. A lot of them have Pokémon that are clearly stronger than mine. Some even have two or three of them! My confidence wavers slightly.
>
> "All right everyone," Professor Pepper says from behind me. "We're going to get started in just a moment."

> After a few minutes of training, Vic left to get ready for her match. "I'm going to go shower and change," she said, getting up from her chair. She was about to walk out the door when Emmit stopped her.
> 
> "You don't have to do that," he said, pointing at Vic's Poke-balls. "They're not like your Pokémon — they'll be fine."
> 
> "It doesn't matter," she said. "I've been living with these creatures since I was four years old. They're my life."
> 
> Vic walked over to the table where the Poke-balls were lined up next to each other. One of them was different from the others: it was a green ball with black lines around it. Vic picked it up and tossed it into her bag.

> "I'm bringing Banette with me anyway," she said, walking back towards the door. "She's my partner. She can take care of me if anything happens."
> 
> Emmit nodded as Vic walked out of his room.

> **Wandering through the tall grass,** I saw a group of three Pokémon standing around something in the middle. A small human boy stood beside them, holding out his hand as he pointed to one of the Pokémon. It was an Onix that looked like it had been digging up dirt and throwing rocks for fun. The other two were a pair of Pidgey, flapping their wings and squawking at each other.
> 
> "Hello," I said as I approached them. "Do you mind if I take a look?"

> **I hear a screech and suddenly a group of** four Hariyama are charging at me. I leap to the side, dodging their claws as they try to get around my left flank. I'm not sure what I can do against them with my own Pokémon but I don't have time to think about it now. They're fast, but not nearly as quick as my Arcanine. As one of the Hariyama gets close enough to attack, I order Arcanine to use its Quick Attack on him while I throw a Fire Stone in his direction. The Hariyama lets out an angry roar and leaps away from me.
> 
>"That's two down!" I shout as I check my map for more enemies. "Let's keep going."
> 
> We continue through the jungle until we reach another clearing where there is a small stream running across our path. There's a bridge that leads over the water and beyond it, I see the faint outline of a building surrounded by trees. It looks like a temple or something similar, but I can't be sure because the light is too dim to make anything out clearly.
> 
> "Should we rest here?" I ask Treyni.
> 
> She shakes her head. "No, we need to find the way inside before nightfall."

*Note: These examples were done on an otherwise new vanilla scenario (default settings, no bias, lorebooks, or anything) however I do recommend using [Loki's Pokédex phrase bias](https://rentry.co/biases#pokedex) or an otherwise similar bias to help reinforce Pokémon appearance, etc.*

##### [Xenoarchaeology and Relics](https://files.catbox.moe/p3s53j.module)

[by OccultSage](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/873782530443182110)

*This module draws from books that have a strong sense of xenoarchaeology and discovering ancient alien treasures as well as large, and small wonders from the past. Many of the sources are narrow, and some of the others are broad in scope.*

>**The light of the blue star beat down on Alexandria's head, as she bent over the relic that her crew had dug out in the pit.**
>
>It was a dark lumpy thing about half an arm long and two fingers thick. It looked like something from another world: all strange angles and curves, with sharp edges everywhere, some shiny, others dull or pitted by corrosion. The top of it tapered into a point; its bottom widened to form what might be a hand-hold. There were no markings anywhere.
>
>"What is this?" asked Alexandria. "I've never seen anything quite like it." She poked at the object with one finger.
>
>"Don't touch it!" snapped Fura. "You'll get splinters. And don't breathe too close either—it could kill you instantly if your lungs are filled with air particles."
>
>Alexandria drew back immediately, but before she did so she noticed a faint smell coming off the artifact. It wasn't unpleasant, just odd, and somehow familiar. Like... yes, like the scent of fresh bread baking in a kitchen oven. Or hot metal being poured. But there was more than one kind of heat involved here, and none of them belonged to any human construct.

##### [Zombie Apocalypse](https://files.catbox.moe/x2og31.module)

[by Basileus](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/875929471184695296)

*Civilization falls, the dead rise! Action, survival, and terror in the zombie apocalypse.*

>**From the darkness of the alley, shuffling footsteps and a long, low moan** echoed.
>
>"What was that?" she whispered to herself as she drew her gun from its holster. She held it in front of her face with both hands, taking aim at the shadows on the opposite side of the street. "Is someone out there? Who's making all that noise?"
>
>The footsteps came closer, and now they were accompanied by another sound—a strange scraping sound like claws dragging across concrete or metal. It wasn't an animal, though; it sounded too human for that. And it didn't seem to be coming from one person either...it seemed to come from several people walking together.
>
>She took careful aim down the length of the alleyway, but couldn't see anything past the first few feet. The moonlight was just enough to show her what looked like a group of shadowy figures approaching through the dark streets.

##### [Androids, Artificial Intelligence, and Robots](https://files.catbox.moe/fjk5vk.module)

[by OccultSage](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/874403674984685639)

*If you love exploring the relationships and interactions between androids, robots, artificial intelligences, and humans, this is the module for you! It covers Issac Asimov, Martha Wells' Murderbot, Charles Stross' Saturn's Children and others.*

>**\*\*\***
>
>**The android** had to have a name. I called it Ganymede, after the moon of Jupiter. It was the only one who could handle the heavy lifting and get us into orbit quickly enough. The other three were too small for that job.
>
>I didn't know what else to call them, so I gave each one an arbitrary designation. I chose the names based on their personalities or something they said in passing. In my opinion, they weren't very good at anything except being robots, but we couldn't afford to be choosy about our crew members. If we got stuck with someone stupid, we'd probably die trying to fix him.
>
>As far as personality went, I tried not to judge people by looks alone; however, if you looked closely at all four of these guys, there was no mistaking any of them. They might look like humans, but they were machines inside---androids programmed to act human. Sooner or later, though, I would need to make some decisions. Maybe this trip would help me decide which ones should go home when we returned from space.
>
>"You can see Earth now," Yuki told me. She pointed out the window. "We're going up."

##### [Angels and Demons](https://files.catbox.moe/cl2t7p.module)

[by OccultSage](https://discord.com/channels/854479693503660032/870494065446248458/878754833497206805)

*Module focused on Angels and Demons trained on a variety of sources from authors like Michele Hauf, Bella Swann, Michael Dalton, Kathryn Moon and Elliot Kay -- high quality erotica.*

*Strong themes of corruption, capture, and BDSM.*

*Also has A Lady of Rooksgrave Manor twice to infuse a little bit of monstrous cross-genre, as it's such a fantastic work.*

*6.8mb, ~8000 steps, ~100% coverage, 2.68 loss.*

>**\*\*\***
>
>**The Succubus smiled at me.** "You have a strong spirit, my dear." She leaned forward to kiss the top of my head and whisper in my ear. "I like that about you." Her lips brushed against mine as she spoke. I felt her warm breath on my neck. My skin tingled from it. It was an odd sensation -- almost pleasant. The demon's tongue flicked out and lapped at the side of my throat. A shiver ran down my spine.
>
>"Mmm," I moaned softly into her mouth. "What are you doing?"
>
>She laughed with glee, letting go of me so she could straighten up. "Enjoying myself for once!" She giggled again before turning back toward the mirror. Her hands moved over herself slowly, teasingly. "It is nice being able to touch your body this way. You are quite beautiful, Rachel. Your breasts look delicious."
>
>My face flushed hot. I couldn't help but notice how hard my nipples were beneath my shirt. They ached slightly even though they weren't erect yet. There was no denying what had happened when we'd kissed earlier, either. We both knew exactly where our bodies wanted each other to be touching right now.
>
>"Are there any more demons here besides us?" asked Alex. His voice sounded strained. He didn't seem comfortable talking around his sister. Maybe he wasn't sure if she would agree to speak with him or not? Or maybe he just didn't want to say anything else.
>
>"Not here, sweetie," said the succubus. "We're alone. But don't worry; I'm going to take care of you soon enough."
>
>Alex gulped loudly.
>
>I looked between them, trying to figure something out. What did they mean by 'take care' of him? Wasn't that kind of vague? Did she mean sexually? If so...well, I guess I should expect nothing less than the best from a succubus!
>
>"Don't worry, Alex," she continued, pulling off her blouse. "This won't hurt much at all."
>
>Her bra came next. Then she unbuttoned her skirt and let it drop to the floor. She stepped out of it completely, leaving only her white panties covering her dark pubic hair. Her legs were smooth and pale, except for some light tan lines running along their length. Her feet were small and dainty.
>
>All eyes were fixed upon her perfect body. Even the ones belonging to two who were supposed to be in love with each other.
>
>The Succubus grinned at me wickedly. "Do you like my new outfit?"
>
>"Um ... yeah, um ..." I stammered awkwardly.
>
>"Well then, why don't you get undressed too?"

>**\*\*\***
>
>**The angel** was waiting for her when she arrived. "Thank you, Lorelei," he said with a smile as the door shut behind them. He held out his hand and helped her down from the carriage. She took it gratefully. The air smelled like fresh rain on the wind that blew in through an open window. It had been months since she'd last visited this place. Her wings were still sore from their flight here, but they felt better than ever before.
>
>"How are you?" he asked. His voice was soft and warm.
>
>She smiled at him. "I'm well."
>
>He nodded once. "Good. I have something to show you."
>
>They walked past several rooms filled with bookshelves full of bound volumes, some old and worn, others new and crisp. There were no windows in these halls. Instead there were arched openings where light streamed in from above. They passed by paintings of angels and men and women holding hands or embracing each other, all smiling happily. Some looked up toward the ceiling, while others gazed down upon the floor below. In one painting, two lovers stood side-by-side, sharing a kiss. A third man watched over them both, his expression unreadable. Another showed three children sitting together around a table playing cards. Their smiles seemed genuine, though perhaps not entirely free of worry. Two more depicted scenes of violence: a woman being strangled by a demon's claws; another woman pinned beneath the body of a fallen soldier. Both images made Lorelei shiver.
>
>In contrast, a few pictures showed couples kissing tenderly under stars shining brightly overhead. One featured a young boy standing next to his mother. The way they looked into each other's eyes spoke volumes about how much love they shared.
>
>Lorelei stopped walking and turned back to look at the angel who led her. "What is this place? Is it Heaven?"
>
>His brow furrowed slightly. "No. This is my home. And it's yours too, if you choose to stay."
>
>"But why would I want to do such a thing? You're immortal, aren't you? Why would anyone bother to keep you alive?"
>
>"It's what we do," he answered simply. "We are angels. We serve God, just as any human does. But unlike humans, our purpose isn't limited to this world alone. Our souls live forever, so long as we continue to walk alongside Him. As for why someone might care enough to keep us here...that's between me and God." He paused for a moment, then added, "You don't need to know anything else unless you wish to learn."
>
>A chill ran down her spine at his words. He didn't seem particularly concerned with answering her questions, and she found herself wanting to press further. Was that because he wanted to keep things that way, or did he truly believe she wouldn't be interested? She wasn't sure which answer pleased her most. Either way, she decided to let him lead the conversation. After all, she could always ask later. If he refused to tell her, that was fine. She'd find out soon enough anyway.
>
>As they continued on, the doors opened onto a large room filled with dozens of beds. Each bed was occupied by an angel, either sleeping peacefully or staring blankly off into space. All wore white robes, and many had wings folded neatly against their backs. Most of them appeared healthy, but some looked ill, pale and thin. Many of the sickest ones lay curled up in fetal positions. Others were hooked up to IVs or machines. None of them moved or reacted when the pair entered the room. Lorelei wondered whether they were even aware of the people around them.
>
>The angel walked over to one of the closest beds and knelt down. It was empty. "This one was lost when the angels fell from heaven," he said. "He was one of the first, and the last. His name was Adam."
>
>Adam. That was the same man whose soul Lorelei had stolen. Her chest tightened. She couldn't imagine the pain of losing your life and having it taken away. It was unimaginable.

##### [Catgirls](https://files.catbox.moe/khewvl.module)

[by Cass](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/874923857667059732)

*A module that helps introduce catgirls into a story! All stories use the term "catgirl", so this term will likely produce the best results. Inspired to counteract Sigurd’s bias to always include fur. (commissioned)*

> [ Describe the Catgirls ]
>
>The girls looked like human females with cat ears or tails attached. Their eyes were blue instead of brown but their pupils were circular rather than oval shaped. It didn't look as if they had fur on their bodies because you could see their skin under their clothes.

##### [Communism](https://files.catbox.moe/wmqa70.module)

[by Pure](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/893277209157066762)

*A basic module made from several works of classic communist, socialist, and anarchist literature. Doesn't have many steps, it was just for testing purposes. Enjoy.*

##### [Count Grey](https://files.catbox.moe/ozd9iw.module)

[by Chris](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/888963250560069713)

##### [Cross-Genre](https://files.catbox.moe/4x7os9.module)

[by OccultSage](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/872522180997546085)

[10K Steps Vers.](https://files.catbox.moe/jwc6cb.module)

[20MB 22K Steps Vers.](https://files.catbox.moe/d5vy58.module)

*"Hmm," thought OccultSage, " ... what would happen if I tossed in books from my curated and edited pile, and balanced out the influence for a 25% sampling?" This is the result of mixing in Genroku era, surrealist, post-apocalypse and Greek mythology.*

*The result seems to be a general prose/plot-enhancer that can be nudged in the direction of multiple genres easily.*

##### [Cross-Genre: Romance](https://files.catbox.moe/lxcp9b.module)

[by Cass](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/874117712668942388)

*A module that helps introduce romantic elements into any story, cross-genre! The genres included are: Classic Regency, Historical, Mystery, Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Adventure. This version **does not include second person books**, to help improve quality and consistency. Also includes an additional Adventure/Sci-Fi book.*

*7.0mb, 2500 steps, 32% coverage*

*800 step version available [here](https://files.catbox.moe/lxcp9b.module).*

>**[ Location: Space Station Eternis; Setting: Victorian Tea Party, garden; Scene: Romance Between Maddy and the Mysterious Man ]**
>
>**"I'm sorry," I said. "You're not my type."**
>
>The man smiled at me, a slow smile that made his eyes twinkle with amusement. He was quite handsome in an old-fashioned way, with dark hair curling over his collar and strong features. His clothes were of good quality but rather worn—the sort of thing you'd wear to a party on Earth, if it had been held two hundred years ago. I imagined him as he might have looked when young.
>
>He reached out for my hand and took it between both of his own. His touch sent shivers through my body. "That's all right, Miss Chumley. You can't be expected to know what your type is."

##### [Duke Nukem](https://files.catbox.moe/pi9s55.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/346458902/#346505146)

*Hey you! The bastard reading this post on the internet!*

*You had enough of those modules about nerd shit, like books and stuff?*

*Or those ones that tailor to a specific fetish?*

*Want a real manly module?*

*Of course, you do!*

*That is why I'm happy to present the 'Duke Nukem's Quote' module! Now you too can have your AI punch up its dialogue with quotes that sound like they came from Duke Nukem! Train on quotes from various Duke Nukem games! So instead of chewing some ass, try this module, today!*

##### [The Elder Scrolls In-Game Texts](https://files.catbox.moe/6vvi4q.module)

[by ScalyWanderer](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/883144310575480892)

*The module is trained on The Elder Scrolls 2-5 & TESO in-game texts (books, notes, etc.) + the official novels by Greg Keyes.*

> \*\*\*
>
> **"Why walk when you can ride?" the Dunmer smiles**. "It’s more fun, and I know how to do it properly."
>
> The Khajiit says nothing for a moment; she is not accustomed to being told what to do by others. Then her eyes flash with anger as she speaks in an icy tone: “I am no slave! And if your kind are so good at riding horses, then why don't you come down here from that wagon of yours? Why don't we see who rides whom? If you think you're going to get away with this... well ... let me tell you something about us Khajiiti. We have sharp claws, yes — but also sharper teeth. You won’t live long enough to regret crossing my path.”
>
> Her words send chills up the Dark Elf’s spine. He turns pale and drops his hand back onto the reins. The caravan stops moving again.
>
> A few moments later, he looks over at the Khajiit once more. She has climbed back into the wagon, leaving him alone on top of the carriage. Her tail flops angrily against one side of the vehicle, while her ears twitch nervously. It appears she is trying to decide whether or not to jump off right now.
>
> He smiles inwardly. Perhaps there will be another chance to test himself against this female. After all, the Khajiits were known throughout Tamriel as fierce warriors - perhaps they would prove useful allies after all.

##### [Forbidden Lands (Encounters)](https://files.catbox.moe/ltj7zh.module)

[by TravelingRobot](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/873302389589958706)

*A module trained on material from Forbidden Lands, a Swedish open world dark fantasy RPG. Trained on the 42 random encounter from the GM guide (51 steps of data, trained with 500 steps (976%).*
*Will need some rerolling + editing to generate something useful. Tends to break down after the first encounter, so it is recommended to start over anew for each encounter.*

##### [Gay](https://files.catbox.moe/t0kvvx.module)

[by H4RV3YD3NT](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/870457336270053427)

*Trained on about 4mb of M/M romance novels and 1.6mb of smut in ~3k steps. Only the highest quality I could find, of course. Should give the AI more awareness of gay stuff, allow for variety of scenarios that don't suddenly turn you into a woman. Focused more on masculine traits. Lemme know how it goes.*

##### [Gay 2](https://files.catbox.moe/acjraa.module)

[by H4RV3YD3NT](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/871719405007036426)

*A redux of my first tuning, high-quality material clocked at ~7MB trained ~100% on ~7000 steps. Romance your bro, discover yourself as you find brotherhood as part of the hockey or football team, find love and rejection in the big city or the sleepy rural town, as Sigurd embraces masculine fondness. This shouldn't swap your sex and allows for a variety of M/M scenarios. Expect a V3 at some point in the far future when I have time to correct thousands of grammar and spelling mistakes. (Please stop abusing hyphens, parentheses, and "...". Learn how to use a comma, you monsters.)*

##### [Green's RPG](https://files.catbox.moe/7i4db0.module)

[by SGreen](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/873549751386259548)

*Would you like it if Life was more like a Game? interdimensional Inventory, Minimap to your use, Skills, Stats, Quests, HUD, HP, and more? Then this is the module for you.
The module is quit flexible, which makes it easy for you to adjust your Lit-rpg Rules however you wish to do. It has a preference for our modern times.*

*I forgot to remove all "—", I will do so when steps are purchasable*

>**My Wife screamed at me, I didn't know why but I knew what to do. I looked into her face, and used the Insight skill to analyze her motives and emotions.**
>
>The most important thing was that she'd been feeling guilty about something for a long time — it must have had some kind of impact on her psyche. She felt responsible for my brother's death. So I decided to use this guilt against her:
>
>"You're going to tell your father everything," I said calmly. "He'll understand."
>
>She fell silent. I could see how scared she was by the way she fidgeted with her hands and avoided looking at me. It wasn't easy to break someone down like that, especially not when you were just trying to help them. But there are ways of doing it...
>
>I took another step forward. This time, I touched her shoulder gently. The woman flinched slightly as if I'd shocked her, then slowly turned around.
>
>Her eyes filled with tears. Her lips trembled. And finally, she began to sob quietly.
>
>"Don't cry," I told her. "It's all right now. Everything will be fine..."

*Another niche module that I made to test non-biped protagonists. Uploading this because... dunno, maybe someone out there is interested in the catbirds?*

*Trained 3000 steps, around 35% iirc. Was made before loss graph.*

##### [Learning Magic](https://files.catbox.moe/qzunxl.module)

[by spamdogman](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/882249776173813810)

*A module trained on scenes of characters learning and practicing magic, as well as in-universe textbooks on magic. I added one-third more text to the training data and fixed some formatting I missed the first time. 1036 steps, 907KB, Trained at 100.20%*

##### [LitRPG](https://files.catbox.moe/fpey2h.module)

[by Zaltys](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/881826911972634634)

*Trained on fantasy LitRPG books. This module was made for testing both LitRPG elements (standardized to use ─ ) and <> bracketing for thinking/telepathy. Seems to work ok, so I might as well publish this. Kudos to Mr.Accountant for contributing the steps. If someone tries this and runs into issues, let me know.*

*(As v3 lacks base LitRPG data, this'll often default to pulling skills from the D&D data. It also overuses semicolon, but that's more of an issue with the old v3 data than with the module.)*

*Training: 3120 steps, 10.1MB. Trained at around 31%, last loss 2.6179. Various authors, but I won't go into details about exactly which books were included.*

> I blinked, looking down at my hands. I had to admit that the glowing blue light was a little unnerving, but I’d grown used to it over time. The new skills were still taking some getting used to though. In fact, they were so much more than just skills. They were part of me now. My own special magic.
>
> And the best part?
>
> ─ You are now able to summon and control magical creatures!
>
> That was one hell of an upgrade.
>
> The other new abilities were:
>
> ─ Improved perception (range increased by 50%)
>
> ─ Increased dexterity by 25%
>
> ─ Increased strength by 10%
>
> ─ Your mana pool has been doubled!
>
> Those were all great improvements, but what really caught my attention was this last ability.
>
> ─ You can now cast spells without using any components or incantations!
>
> This was amazing. It meant I could use my magic without having to worry about spending money on supplies like I always did before. And the most important thing? No chanting required! This would allow me to do things like cast fireballs with no problems. All I needed was enough mana to create the spell and then simply focus my mind on casting it. Simple as that.

##### [Magical Girls: Battle Royale](https://files.catbox.moe/hz84g9.module)

*[One of two] Magical Girls modules. [This one] is trained on magical girls and battle royale (warning: very dark).*

>"It's a lie," Mary said. "I don't know what happened to him." She looked away from the woman, her eyes searching for something on the other side of the room. The walls were decorated with paintings and photographs, some in frames, others hung askew. A few had been torn or cut out of their frames; one photo was missing its glass entirely. There seemed to be no pattern to how they'd been arranged. It made it difficult to tell where she should look next.
>
>The woman smiled at them again, but this time there wasn't any warmth behind those lips. Her teeth were yellowed white. "You're lying," she repeated. "Or you aren't who he thinks you are. Either way, I'm going to find out."
>
>Mary felt dizzy. Everything was moving around her so quickly that she couldn't keep up. The only thing keeping her upright was Mr. Quinlan's hand gripping hers tightly. He didn't seem able to pull himself together enough to speak, either.
>
>They were surrounded by darkness now. No more light filtered through the windows. They could hear nothing except the blood pounding inside of Mary's ears. Then she saw movement near the door leading into another part of the building. Someone stepped back after letting someone else pass, then turned toward the group sitting across from the desk. And when the shadow moved closer, Mary recognized the face staring down at them: Jack's mother.

>The girl was on her back, looking up at the sky. Her face had a blank expression as if she were seeing something far away. The amount of blood flowing from her mouth and nose made it look like she'd been stabbed in the throat with an ice pick. It seemed that she hadn't died yet but...

>"What are you going to do now?"

>"...I'm sorry."
>
>That's right, I said "sorry," didn't I? What am I doing apologizing all of a sudden?! She tried to kill me! I had no choice but to defend myself!
>
>Her lips moved slightly; maybe she was trying to say something. I couldn't hear anything though because my ears still hurt so much. Then what about Kotoe-chan...? Wasn't she supposed to be here too? Where is she anyway? Maybe she went down fighting somewhere else or got kidnapped by someone else for some reason...? No wait, don't think about it anymore—it'll just make your head hurt more than ever...

*A utility module trained on various detailed fight scenes across many stories from The Iliad to The Princess Bride, from Logen Ninefingers in The First Law to Eowyn in The Return of the King and more. Focused mainly on melee and hand-to-hand combat in pre-modern era settings. All names have been replaced with pronouns and titles like "boy/man/woman" or "fighter/warrior/opponent" to discourage source material leaking.*

*I have found this module also works well for detailed non-sexualized physical descriptions for characters in adventuring gear or armor.*

>He could have hit her, but the best he could manage was a glancing blow to one of the other women's hands. She howled and caught at him with those long nails. He jumped back just in time to avoid them. A dark figure loomed up out of nowhere as he tried to dodge past it. The attacker came straight for his throat—but he twisted aside easily enough and seized its arm. It didn't seem to realize what had happened; if anything, it seemed surprised that there'd been an attack from behind. When it turned around again, though, it saw who it had grabbed and yanked hard on the sleeve of his shirt.
>
>"You!" he said angrily. "I thought you were dead."
>
>She smiled thinly and drew herself up proudly before him. "So did I," she replied sweetly.

> He knew he was in trouble. The detective's face had been calm, but there had been a look of triumph on his partner's face that made him think they'd found the right place to start looking for their missing boy. He hadn't wanted them here, and he didn't want to be found by them. It would mean questions about where he'd gone, who he'd seen, and what he might have told them.
> 
> "I'm not going back," he said, trying to sound strong. "It's all over."
> 
> The man was silent, just staring at him. He felt a hand touch his shoulder and looked up into the eyes of a woman standing behind him. She wore a dark blue dress with an open white blouse underneath. Her hair was long and blonde and hung down her back in loose curls. He wondered how old she was, but couldn't tell.
> 
> She smiled at him, then stepped forward so that she stood directly in front of him. He could smell her perfume, and it made him feel dizzy. His heart began to beat faster.
> 
> "We're not police officers," she said. "But we know people who are."
> 
> Her voice sounded soft, like velvet. It reminded him of the first time he'd met her.

*Expect a healthy dash of Victorian spice. Where version one of Purely Purple Prose was made to give people a feel for what the Purple Prose Supplementary Data could add to one's own modules, version two was crafted specifically to hone in on the "Classical" nature inherent with fiction under Creative Commons. To that end I cleaned up a few of the completed works to train alongside the regular dataset, giving you the benefits of the tags with nothing to hold the prose back.*

The wind howled through the trees, which bent before it like reeds in a flood; and every now and then came a great clap of thunder that shook the old house to its foundations.

*The purpose of this module is to give NAI a better idea of sergals, both in canon and non-canon stories. Most of the texts used are SFW, but there're some erotic scenes too. Official Vilous Wiki (the data is cleaned by hand) + several well-written fan-fiction texts taken from FurAffinity.*

> **Just like any other sergal, I'm** not exactly proud of my past. In fact, it's something that every member of our clan has in common. However, when you hear the story behind why we're called the Silver Fang Clan, you can't help but find a bit of pride for us. It was the name given to us by one of our original members and founder after he fought off an entire horde of enemies with nothing more than his two swords — the only weapons he had on him at the time. And because of this, we became known as the Silver Fangs ever since then. We are no longer considered a small mercenary band and have risen up from strength to strength over these many years. Though there is always some who claim otherwise, that particular nickname will be carried forward forevermore! Not all clans and soldiers alike come into existence through war or fighting against another group. Some clans formed by merchants or traders who needed protection; others developed out of friendships between members of different villages. While most do join together because they share similar goals, motivations vary greatly amongst those seeking what seems to be the same thing: profit.
>
> Sergals tend to see their work within each individual village differently compared to how outsiders might perceive them. They may view themselves as protecting, defending, assisting, supporting... whatever words suit your fancy. What matters isn't the meaning, however, but rather its results. As long as the end result is favourable to everyone involved, even if there's been bloodshed along the way, it doesn't matter how they got there so long as everything eventually leads towards peace and prosperity for both parties.

>**The journey** to the station was long and tedious, with many stops at stations. I remember that we had tea in a little cafe near Victoria Station. And there were crowds of people waiting for trains: men with newspapers under their arms, women clutching parcels; children playing on the platforms and running about as if they owned them.
>
>"You don't have to go," said Richard, but she insisted. "I'll be all right."
>
>She bought some sandwiches from one of those stalls you see everywhere—the ones that sell only bread, cheese, ham, or fish-and-chips—which seemed very odd to me. She gave her ticket to the porter who came around collecting fares, then sat down beside him on an empty bench, eating her sandwich and reading The Times. I watched her for a while. She looked so peaceful sitting there, nibbling away like that. I wanted to sit next to her. But it wasn't my place. I didn't want to intrude. So I went back into the station and wandered up and down looking at the posters and trying not to look too interested.

>He sat right in front of me, on the same table as me and my parents. I wanted him, desired him, but I had to wait until we have eaten. My parents were watching us with curiosity. It was only then that I felt like a real woman who has sex. He kept looking at me with lustful eyes while he ate his food. He started eating slowly, taking small bites from each piece of meat. When he reached the vegetables, he paused for a moment and looked up at me. I blushed and averted my gaze. But when I saw him take another bite, I became excited again. His tongue moved along the edge of his teeth before it slipped into his mouth. His hands caressed the sides of his face and neck. I could feel my own nipples harden under my top. They pressed against the thin material of my dress. The more he touched himself, the harder they got.
>
>I glanced around the restaurant and noticed all the other couples sitting together. Some people were holding hands, some kissed passionately. All of them seemed happy and satisfied. That's what I needed. I needed someone who would make me feel like that. And now I knew who it was. I smiled at him and leaned forward so that our faces were close enough to kiss. He looked back at me with surprise, but then quickly returned his attention to his meal. As soon as I realized that he didn't want to be caught doing something inappropriate in public, I stopped smiling. I straightened myself up and turned away from him. I picked up my fork and began eating. After a few minutes, I took a deep breath and relaxed my shoulders. My heart was beating faster than normal. I couldn't believe how much I'd been waiting for this man. Now that he was here, everything else seemed less important. This was the most exciting thing that ever happened to me.
>
>"Do you know why you're still single?" he asked after a long pause. "You're beautiful."
>
>I nodded shyly. I wasn't sure if I should say anything or not.
>
>"But there are many men who want you," he continued. "They just don't see your true beauty yet. You need to find one who will appreciate you completely."
>
>I closed my eyes and let out a sigh. He really did understand me. How lucky am I?
>
>"So tell me, Elena," he said softly. "What do you think about when you masturbate?"
>
>My eyes flew open wide. What does he mean by that? He knows what I'm thinking! Why is he asking me these questions? I tried to answer calmly, but I failed miserably. I stammered and blushed. He laughed at my discomfort.
>
>"Don't worry," he reassured me. "I won't judge you. It's perfectly natural to have fantasies. Especially since we've already established that you enjoy it."
>
>He winked at me. I blushed even deeper. I had no idea what to say next. Finally, I managed to ask him a question.
>
>"Can I please touch myself now?"
>
>His eyes sparkled with amusement. "Of course."
>
>He stood up and walked towards the door. Then he turned around and held his hand out to me. "Come on."

>The PCs find a small outpost of the US Army. The soldiers are friendly, but they have no weapons and very little ammunition left for their rifles (only one bullet per soldier). They offer to let the PCs stay in return for some food or help with hunting down marauding wolves that threaten their livestock. If any PC is wounded during this encounter, it will be healed by an American doctor if he can get him there quickly enough. In addition, the Americans may provide them with information on local military units – such as which ones were stationed here before being withdrawn from the region, what kind of equipment was used and so forth.

*Trained on Nonfiction Nature books that emphasize description and focus on the biology, history, and habits of animals and creatures, this module aims to breathe life into your story's wilds.*

>The story of the red-crowned crane is a classic example of how one species can have an impact on another. The first record of this bird's existence in North America was by early explorers, who saw it as they sailed up and down what we now know to be the Mississippi River. They described its coloration—red crown, black back, white underparts with dark spots—and noted that their descriptions were very similar to those written about Asian cranes. These observations led scientists to believe that these birds had been brought over from Asia during the 1600s when Europeans started exploring the continent.

*This module was trained with a dozen of Zombie Apocalypse/Survival novels.*

>**"Keep you voice down" I whispered.**
>
>I could hear the faint sounds of distant fighting from outside, but they were too far away for me to be able to make out what was going on. We had no idea where we were in relation to any of our friends and family, so there was a lot more than just a little risk involved in trying to go back out into that chaos. The fact that the dead were already starting to move toward us made it even less appealing. We needed to find someplace safe before things got worse.
>
>We walked along the road until we came across an abandoned house. It looked like someone had tried to repair the place up a bit, but not enough to make it livable. There was one window with bars over it, but nothing else seemed useful. Lee grabbed my hand and pulled me inside. He went straight to the fireplace and started pulling wood out of the wall. After he'd gotten several armloads, he began piling them on top of each other near the front door. He continued this process until he had a pile about three feet high. He then took a lighter out of his pocket and set fire to the wood. As soon as the flames reached the first piece of kindling, Lee shut off the gas valve and left the room.
>
>I watched him walk around the corner of the building and disappear from view. A moment later, the sound of gunfire echoed through the area, followed by screams and moans. I didn't know if anyone was still alive, or how many people might have been taken by surprise when the zombies broke through their defenses. My heart sank at the thought of being trapped in here without any way out.

>Lee returned shortly after the shooting stopped.

>
>She had me there! The images of her beautiful butt filled with cum from last night flashed through my mind. I felt like such an asshole now. I knew exactly how much she wanted to be fucked by another man's cock. And here I am thinking about fucking her ass when all along she has been wanting mine. But, damn did she have a great body! Her tits looked amazing and her pussy... well, I've never seen one look better than hers. It was shaved smooth and already dripping wet. I could see the outline of her clit under the hood. That alone made me hard just looking at her. Damn, she must really love sex!

*This was an experiment in seeing if we could use higher quality sourced erotica around a theme; these were all sourced from bought ebooks, in the theory that you get what you pay for.*

>**\*\*\***
>**The alien gazed at me with desire in its eyes.** I couldn't help but feel a stirring inside of my loins as it continued to stare into my soul, and the longer we looked at each other, the more I wanted this creature. It was an animalistic thing that drew on primal instincts; I could see how it had been able to take over so many humans and assimilate them into their society. And now it wanted me? The thought made my heart race with excitement. If only it were possible for us to have sex...
>
>"You are very beautiful," I said after a moment's pause. "I would like to touch you." My voice sounded strange coming from my mouth, and there was something different about my face, too. I wasn't sure what exactly changed when I spoke, but it seemed to make my speech slightly slurred. But then again, maybe that was just because I'd been drinking wine all night. Either way, I didn't care if I stumbled or stuttered. All I cared about right now was getting close enough to kiss this sexy alien girl.
>
>It nodded its head once before stepping closer towards me. Its body swayed hypnotically as it moved, making it difficult to focus on anything else besides those sensual curves. When our lips met, I almost came immediately. Our tongues danced together for several moments, exploring one another's mouths. Then the alien wrapped her arms around my neck and pulled herself tightly against me. Her breasts pressed firmly against mine through the thin fabric.

> **The succubus was beautiful** but she had not been built to be a pleasure toy.

> "You are in my way," the demon said coldly. "I am busy." She looked at me and her eyes glittered with hunger. I could smell it on her breath; that scent of decay mixed with desire. Her hand went down between us. It moved slowly across my chest as if testing for resistance or weakness before reaching into my pants. When its fingers brushed against my cock, they were cool and slick from sweat. The creature's touch sent shivers through my body, even though we stood naked together in front of an audience. My erection throbbed painfully under her palm. A drop of pre-cum oozed out onto her fingertips. That small movement alone made me want more. More than anything else I'd ever felt. But this wasn't real life. This was just another fantasy come true. Still, there was no denying how much I wanted what lay beneath those thin black gloves. With slow deliberation, she slid them up over both hands until only two fingers remained inside my manhood. Then one finger slipped into me easily while her other held tight to my shaft. She began pumping gently back and forth, stroking herself along my length like some kind of obscene machine. Slowly, inexorably, her grip tightened around my dick.
>
> It hurt so good.
>
> As the pain faded away, something new took its place. Something wonderful, thrilling, delicious. Desire coursed through every part of me as she pumped faster and harder. Moaning softly, I wrapped my arms around her waist and pulled myself closer. Fingers dug into my ass cheeks hard enough to leave bruises. Hot breath tickled the side of my neck. Somewhere above our heads, someone moaned in delight.
>
> Then suddenly, without warning, the demon stopped moving. One hand still gripping my cock tightly, she withdrew her fingers completely. There came a wet sound when she let go of my shaft. For several seconds nothing happened. Just silence. No music played in my ears, nor did any words echo in my mind. Only emptiness filled my thoughts. And then, almost too quickly to register, the world returned to normal. Sound poured into my senses again: soft breathing, heavy footsteps, moaning laughter echoing throughout the room.
>
> She smiled wickedly at me and licked her lips. "That is quite impressive," she purred. "But you will never know satisfaction unless your partner gives consent."
>
> "No!" I gasped. "Don't stop! Please don't stop."
>
> Her smile widened. "Oh yes, Master Kade. You can have all the sex you wish tonight. Anything you want. All of it. Forever."

>**They** were both panting, and the heat in their loins was growing.

>"I can't believe we're doing this," Nera said quietly, but with a hint of awe. "It's... it's so hot." She looked down at her own body, then back up to Cerise. Her tail curled around herself as she pressed closer against the other drake, trying to get even more contact between them. They weren't quite touching yet; there was still some space between them. It felt like they could do that if only they wanted to be close enough together for things to happen. But instead, they remained where they were. The two dragonesses just stared into each others' eyes, breathing heavily from arousal. Their tails swished slowly side-to-side while they waited for something else to start happening.
>
>Cerise reached out one paw towards Nera's snout, gently brushing her fingers across it. Then another paw joined in, stroking along the same spot on Nera's face, making soft circles over her cheek scales. Nera leaned forward slightly, pressing their noses together again, closing their mouths too.

*I threw together an ENF (Embarrassed Naked Female) module*

*Fempov, First Person recommended.*

##### [Embarrassed Naked Female (Third Person)](https://files.catbox.moe/fnf1im.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/348767728/#348799156)

*It should be similar to the ENF fempov module, except, well, third person.*

*(For a fun time, start a new story with a female name and a verb, and just keep generating)*

##### [Embarrassed Naked Furry](https://files.catbox.moe/o92av4.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/349741726/#349745423)

*Thrown 2250 steps at this, and I called it Furry ENF in case it's not actually overtrained and I want to keep it.*

*Contains Bondage and Dominance, NonConsent*

*Embarrassed nude females, who are anthropomorphic animals interacting with other anthropomorphic animals.*

*Stuff included in training material to watch out for: non-con, con, sexual torture, your plain old normal torture, incest, bestiality, necro, watersports, maybe scat though I'm not sure.*

*Stuff NOT included in training material: furries. Sorry. Not my fault. The subreddit only writes about humans and normal animals for some reason.*

*Each story has been tagged. Tags are in format: [ Tags: tag1, tag2, tag3 ]. Note that the word "Tag" is capitalized but the tags themselves aren't. Tags included both fetishes/CWs and types of sex (f/f, m/f, etc.). The module doesn't really adhere to them, but they help guide it.*

*Each story had \*\*\* between them, so typing three asterisks won't start a new chapter but rather a new story.*

*I'm not sure about the best settings for the module, but it seems to be working adequately on the default ones with a lot of hand-holding.*

##### [Erotic Horror](https://files.catbox.moe/xelxsy.module)

*The latest in my series of horror modules. Should be relatively high-quality prose, but tends toward horror as much as erotica (however, I didn't feel like I should post it on the main Discord since it is significantly weighted towards the lewd). Should work reasonably for anything from Eyes Wide Shut or Carmilla to Hellraiser or Agony levels of grotesque delight and dark ecstasy. Some variety of creature/monster stuff in the source material, alongside the more "mundane".*

*6MB, 50%; 16 well-rated and/or top-selling horror and erotic horror anthologies. Since there are dozens of authors, I won't list them all.*

*Okay, here we go, I did it. This is based off five years of ERP with a partner. Proceed at your own risk.*

*It's vorefag stuff, but we did all sorts of fetish stuff from feet to inflation. It's unformatted so the first few outputs will have timestamps. but that goes away almost instantly once you purge some of it.*

##### [Exponent](https://files.catbox.moe/g80glt.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/346210503/#346281993)

*I made a module trained on stories I generated, it focuses on monster fucking, but works well for robots and other shit too.*

- *It's kind of shit if the thing you're dicking is a human as it tends to call things "creature" or "monster", and can give them fur/scales randomly.*
- *All material was first person, so it is extremely hard to break away from that, even forcing third person makes the story introduce you as a bystander.*
- *Heavily focused on inner monologue stuff, and sense of touch/scale/hearing.*
- *For some reason I feel it's both making the dialogue more coherent, and introducing random ass grammatical errors into the dialogue. Wasn't even much dialogue in the training set, so my writing must have tapped into something.*
- *Makes the AI really degenerate too, a small breeze blowing on you (the protagonist) makes your dick spring to life, but takes a while to coom.*

*Please enjoy.*

*I wrote something that assigns scores to stories from literotica with the highest density of given keywords and key phrases. It then takes the top 50 stories and re-formats them into the needed module training format. My first experiment was trying to get a bunch of foot fetish stories with bratty/humiliating undertones. I personally haven't tried it yet as I've only woken up but I wanted to share anyway.*

*A general furry module not focusing on particular species or topics. The module is trained on a vast amount of short and medium-sized texts. Most of them are NSFW, both M/F and M/M, without any extreme fetishes, apart from several BDSM stories. A fair amount of dragon/gryphon material is included, too. As you can see from the examples, this module makes NAI horny from the very start. 96 hand-picked and cleaned furry novels and short stories taken from FurAffinity and several other sources.*

*5.2 Mb, 2411 steps, 40% coverage, Loss: 2.696.*

> **My tail twitched with excitement**, my cock was so hard I thought it might break. And then the tigress rolled to her back and spread those long legs of hers apart...and she raised one paw high into the air while the other reached for me, a beckoning motion that called me closer still as if telling me to come on over.
>
> I crawled between those soft thighs like some kind of moth drawn in by her alluring perfume. She grabbed hold of my wrists and pulled them up above my head, trapping me there while she pushed me down until my muzzle pressed firmly against her wet cuntlips.
>
> "Mmm..." The words escaped from her mouth as a moan. "So nice." Her fingers came together in an arch behind my shoulders, squeezing lightly at first before releasing again, forcing me even further towards her slick folds.

##### [Futarotica](https://files.catbox.moe/x3lugm.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/348276163/#348342634)

*Because the last version was "overtrained" and didn't even encompass all 88 stories, here is the third version of Futarotica. Trained on all 88 stories (13MB) to 3600~ steps.*

*Be interesting to see if this one is an improvement or not.*

##### [Futrap](https://files.catbox.moe/m3ouwu.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/348276163/#348359413)

*This is futa on male-protagonist smut-only from CoC2 and TiTS, so it's second person (does work in first person but you might have to force it a bit). Protagonist is a trap but I don't think it matters, since it doesn't really come up a lot. It's made from basically all the major futa characters (so it's mostly futadom) from those two games. Probably has a bit of a bias towards blowjobs with how much of these the games feature.*

*About 500kb of text trained with 100% steps. Apparently for fetish stuff from smaller data you're supposed to use 100% so I did that.*

*This is a module focused on bondage, Dom/sub interactions and male on male sex, mostly from a submissive perspective.*

*The module will reliably produce gay sex scenarios as well as scenes with restraints, although Sigurd will sadly still be often quite confused about what those restraints should actually do.*

*Trained on select stories from the MetalbondNYC story archive. Took around 2000 steps, full coverage.*

*A module trained on a lot of various hyper muscle growth stories (hyper for both dick and muscle size) from various artists, many of them furry. 72 separate stories, including works that had multiple parts merged into 1 file for training.*
*Using desired memory and author's note tags, as seen in the unofficial github research wiki, seems to help in direction, though it does well enough on its own.*
*Trained in 4764 steps (110%)*

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/345923845/#345940003)

*It is done: The TG/Gender bender module. It's mostly trained from TGStorytime.com from a combination of top and hand picked stories, skipping over crossdressing, body swapping, and realistic surgery. The vast majority of stories used are rated explicit or deviant because of course they are.*

##### [Genroku Ero](https://files.catbox.moe/9c3mvf.module)

*This variant module covers Japans Genroku period, around the 17th century. It draws from authors Laura Joh Rowland and Lucai St. Clair Robinson. Foreigners, samurai, and detectives abound! With a special helping of erotica by Akahiege Namban.*

##### [Giantess](https://mega.nz/file/aU8SnQzI#5sUnfdg9lDc_OUbEKt5FqAAsxH4Bfx43VtAeh4EE1l4)

*It's more focused on growth, but I'll throw my shitty giantess module out there.*

*Stories Included:*

- *Beauty Treatment (cleaned up version)*
- *Click*
- *Beyond the Best Part*
- *Before the Best Part*
- *Amazing Growing Zoey*
- *Part of Out of Las Vegas (the growth through to the end)*
- *Megan In the City*
- *The Breaking Point*
- *Undeserved Power*

- *Growing At the Mall*

##### [Giantess World](https://files.catbox.moe/lwiquz.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/345762590/#345788357)

*This module is focused on giant people interacting with small people, sometimes personally and sometimes at the scale of cities or larger. It draws on authors like Grildrig (none of his furry writing), Inwiththebooks, jellytea as well a selection other writing sourced from Giantess World. Sizes included vary from mini-gts to tera. This module does contain writing with giant males and giant sex. If you don't want them, my testing suggests giant men don't show up unless you write them in yourself since most of the material doesn't feature them. There is incidental vore and watersports included in the training data but I didn't go out my way for detailed stuff focused on it.*

*There are two tokens you may want to ban if they start causing trouble: a long run of tildes and '."'. I triple checked the data and I know I removed all of the dumb dinkuses including tilde ones, but for some reason the tilde one still comes up. The period-quotation mark thing is because of one longer story I missed fixing up the quotation marks in after txt file conversation. I would rerun the training but I don't have enough tokens left for this billing cycle.*

*I used 2.5 MB of data and 2750 steps.*

*Have fun in The City Anons.*

>"I'm sorry, I didn't mean to..." The words came out before she could stop them. She was so embarrassed by the whole situation that her voice cracked and broke on 'sorry'. "It's just... it really feels like you're enjoying this."
>
>He laughed at her comment. "You have no idea how right you are." He took a deep breath as if he were about to say something important. When his eyes met hers again they had changed. They seemed different somehow.
>
>[ Tags: girl-doubts ]
>
>"What is it?" she asked him with trepidation in her voice.
>
>His smile widened and he pulled her into an embrace. "Nothing," he said softly against her hair. His arms tightened around her shoulders and then released her. He looked down at her for a moment and then turned away from her. "Come here," he commanded gently.
>
>She followed him slowly towards the bed and lay back on top of it. Her head rested against one of the pillows and she stared up at him. He knelt between her legs and leaned over her body. Then he pressed his lips against hers and kissed her deeply. A shiver went through her when his tongue entered her mouth. He moved lower until his face hovered above her pussy.
>
>[ Tags: girl-smells ]

>The smell of her arousal filled his nostrils and sent another rush of desire coursing through his veins. He inhaled sharply but did not move any closer to her opening. Instead, he ran his hands lightly across her thighs. As he touched her skin, goose bumps rose all along her flesh. His fingers traced every curve and crevice of her legs. Each touch made her nipples harden even more.

*This collects about 40 full-length novels in the harem lit fantasy genre by authors such as Eric Vall, Logan Jacobs, Dante King, Michael Scott Earle, and many more, and trains them at about 45% at 10,000 steps. As far as I know, this is the biggest and most comprehensive such module for the harem fantasy genre.*

*If you like Monster Girls and explicit harem dynamics in your high fantasy and urban fantasy novels, look no further.*

*In this iteration, I added a couple more stories as well as some of the better output from the previous model.*

*Includes scenario for pokedex general world info, plus banned tokens to keep disgusting humans and dicks out.*

*A module made of a collection of 3 of my favorite long-form/slow-burn mind control stories from Fiction.Live.  All of them are in 2nd person. 2.5k steps, ~87.59% coverage.*

##### [Magic Mind Control](https://mega.nz/file/ZfpmTa6T#bx0VmKdhzj0lz9lJdNXnKyQdyxDJjxh6ODiquwHtEvM)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/345615202/#345739616)

*I trained this module on my favourite mind control smut stories (excluding ones with poor quality prose) from various sources, mostly mcstories.com but a few from ASSTR and Literotica.*

*All stories painstakingly cleaned and formatted to have perfect formatting, no blank lines, normalized quote formats etc (took me the whole damn day)*

**What was included:*

- *Focus was mostly on stories about telepathic or magic mind control, rather than "realistic" methods like hypnosis, drugs or brainwashing*
- *I included a handful of loli mc stories from web.archive.org's archive of Piper's Domain, but they made up less than 10% of the total*
- *Decent amount of mc incest*

*What was NOT included:*

- *Male/male sex of any kind. I used entirely straight or lesbian stories. It might work for gay stories regardless but I dunno. If you're not straight you're might not get a lot out of this model, you should easily be able to train your own using an archive like gayspiralstories*
- *Long hypnotic induction scenes. I don't find those hot and I mostly made this for myself, sorry. So if you're looking for a model for induction scenes ("focus on my watch" "you are getting very sleepy" etc.) I would not use this one, because there isn't any of that in the training data*

*\>Is it any good, anon?*

*Don't know yet, I just made it and haven't tested it much. Mind control is fundamentally a NARRATIVE fetish, rather than one about specific sex acts or body types, which makes it tricky for transformers to understand. I find even davinci often struggles to do MC well. It may turn out that 6B isn't enough to be good at it, even with this module. Failure in this case won't mean incoherence, it'll just mean that output isn't any better for MC than default Sigurd. Try it and see how you go*

*Trained on quite a sizable amount of "Master PC" stories, primarily from literotica.  In case you don't know what that means — it's a sort of shared scenario where someone gets access to a computer program that can modify the mind and body of people.*

*2.4k steps (~60%), and makes use of experimental A/N injection, so A/N should be somewhat stronger than usual.*

##### [Mind Control Induction](https://files.catbox.moe/lmbte8.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/346210503/#346232941)

*Here is the promised mind control induction module. It has been trained on 1MB of excerpts from MC stories, focusing on inductions and similar concepts; these vary in style, tense, perspective, and quality, but hopefully it averages out. I cannot guarantee anything about what it spits out! It does seem to have got the general gist, though obviously it'll need some fiddling and guiding.*

*Unfortunately it seems I did not fully clean the training data, and some �s do appear. I cannot retrain it at the moment as I have ran out of steps; I will do so next month, when I will hopefully have gathered more training data as well.*

*made a new module from my old erp logs, stories i made from the ai and erotica that i liked to see what it would happen. around 700kb of data with all 500 steps i had. it's both worse and better than i expected. the writing is kind of shit but the ai is more coherent and degenerate from low effort starting prompts. it has rape, breeding, gay and straight shit with mostly maledom but small bits of femdom.*

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/345503749/#345592548)

*Here's a module trained on some kino monstergirl novels and fanfics.*

>“We are going to have a lot of fun, I promise you. Now come on! We need to get this ship moving before the sun comes up and we lose all our cover.”
>
>Once we got close enough to the shoreline, Nadir began to take off her clothes until she stood naked from head to toe except for one piece of clothing – a leather loincloth that was tied around her waist. It went down just above her knees but left most of her long legs completely exposed in between. She looked like some sort of exotic dancer as she wiggled out of it with ease.
>
>I couldn’t help myself as my eyes wandered over her body once again. Her breasts were large and perfectly round, not too big or small at all. They sat high on her chest and swayed back and forth when she moved. The nipples were thick and dark pink while they poked through her golden brown fur.
>
>Her stomach was flat and tight while there was an indentation right where her belly button would be if she had one. My cock twitched involuntarily at the thought of sliding inside those soft curves.

*I've been really frustrated with NAI's performance during scenes with multiple partner. I trained a module that consists of FFM, MMF, FFFM, MMMF, and Orgy erotica from Literotica. The results are already substantially better than NAI's typical behavior:*

>[ Scenario: Mike and Dave are going to fuck me at the same time. ]

>I had been with both of them before, but I was still inexperienced when it came to sex in general so they were quite gentle as we began making out passionately on our bed. We kissed deeply for a while until finally my hands reached down between us to feel their cocks. They both moaned loudly as I started rubbing one then quickly moving onto the other. Soon each cock was hard enough that they wanted to go inside me right away. So without any further delay or preparation we got into position side by side facing towards each other. Both guys moved closer together and pushed their hips forward slightly allowing themselves room to thrust into me from behind. My pussy lips opened up invitingly and I felt myself being penetrated once again. This feeling alone is an amazing experience!

*For the above I started with just the scenario.*

*I do not recommend you use this as your default basis, but instead use a module with high quality writing until you get to a multiple partner sex scene. Then switch back when the scene is over.*

>**One day,** she would be free.

>She was not sure how long it had been since the first time he'd used her mouth for his pleasure. It seemed like years ago now that she'd met him and gone with him to the beach house in San Diego where they were living at the time. He'd made her wear a bikini when they went swimming; one of those tiny bikinis that barely covered anything. She remembered being embarrassed by all the attention men gave her as they watched them go into the ocean. Her mother warned her about going out there alone, but she didn't listen. When she saw him swim over to her, she thought maybe this time he wouldn't hurt her...maybe this time he would just use her body instead of abusing it.

##### [Shrunken Women](https://files.catbox.moe/opsw6t.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/345503749/#345565971)

*This was made from a mix of shrunken women stories and fairy stories. They were mostly "Giant male"-centric with submissive or lightly resistant woman. It includes writing by The Reducer as well as stuff I liked from Giantess World and Literotica that fit the theme. I can't say that it's perfect when it comes to stuff like insertions that shouldn't happen, but it gives the AI a lot more vocabulary to understand M/f size relationships.*

*Twenty cleaned-up and formatted stories from various sources trained at ~300%/1k steps. Mixes furries, fanfiction, and original content.

*(pls pm me if you know a place with brainfuck stories, I literally used every good one from FA and AO3)*

*Here is a module trained to 30% on every Animorphs book. Thanks to Pause for training. This does have telepathic dialog that is enclosed in angled brackets. This is something that is supposed to happen. Have fun I guess.*

##### [Assassin's Creed: Ezio Auditore](https://files.catbox.moe/6iadvm.module)

A.K.A Green's Eagle Vision

[by SGreen](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/874109126152712203)

*A module trained with all the novels involving Ezio Auditore - the greatest Assassin. Did you hate something about Assassin's Creed, like Ezio's Family execution? Now you can rewrite his History, or give your own Assassin your Destiny.*

>**Ezio jumped over the rooftops** and landed in a crouch on the other side. He took out his bow, notched an arrow to it, then stood up again.
>
>He saw two figures running towards him from behind the walls of the palazzo: one was holding a sword, the other a dagger. Ezio's first shot missed its target as he had aimed for the throat, but the second hit home and the man fell dead with blood pouring from his neck. As soon as the templars were down, he rushed forward to finish them off, but they disappeared into a doorway before he could reach it. They'd escaped!
>
>But where?
>
>There was no time to waste—he would have to find them quickly or lose them forever. He dashed around the corner and came face-to-face with another pair of men, who looked at him with surprise. It was obvious that neither of them knew what was going on; perhaps they thought he was just some drunken ruffian. But he wasn't about to let himself be taken by surprise again. He drew back his arm and released his arrow in one swift movement. The first man went down clutching at his chest, while the second ran screaming, "Aiuto!"
>
>Ezio chased after him, but the man reached the safety of the nearest house and began pounding on the door. Ezio leapt across the street and grabbed hold of the handle. It opened easily enough, revealing a terrified woman inside. She tried to slam the door shut, but Ezio pushed past her and entered the room. He heard footsteps coming toward him from the far end of the hall. There was nowhere else to hide so he threw open the window and climbed through it onto the roof of the building opposite. His pursuer appeared from the shadows. Ezio put an arrow through his heart.
>
>The assassin slipped silently away, leaving the wounded woman cowering in terror.

##### [Bartimaeus Sequence](https://files.catbox.moe/dyw2gu.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/345923845/#346021343)

*Dunno if this of interest to anyone, but I trained a module on Jonathan Stroud's Bartimaeus Trilogy plus the prequel book. Not sure it works the best because of the perspective switching the book does, but I'm a big fan of the series so I wanted to make this. It would probably be best for succubus/summoning prompts since that's what the series is about.*

##### [Battlefield Earth](https://files.catbox.moe/3hykdl.module)

*Battlefield: Earth is a 1982 sci-fi novel written by L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology. It's mostly known as the film adaptation, which was called "the worst film made" and won 8 Golden Raspberry Awards.*

*From my biased brief looks at the writing, it's a wonder that it was made into a movie.*

*Niche module. I was testing how well v3 handles sentient vehicles.*

*Bolo is a shared universe series about AI tanks. Not regular tank-sized tanks. Bolos are huge, largest model weights 32,000 tons.*

*I doubt there's much interest for this, but it seems to work sufficiently well. AI occasionally tries to give them human features, but that's usually fixable with retries.*

>**The battlecruiser in low orbit opens fire, bathing me in approximately 2.79 megatons/second. My battlescreens fail...**
>
>I am capable of reasoning and calculating as any human would be. As my screens go dark and my shields start failing, I begin a series of calculations designed to keep me alive. My hull temperature rises rapidly, but I am able to divert power from the fusion reactor to coolant systems, allowing my hull to remain intact for now. But there is no longer enough power available to maintain shield integrity or defense against missile impact.
>
>In less than three minutes, I will cease to exist.
>
>I choose not to believe this.
>
>I continue to calculate probabilities, seeking an alternative outcome that might still allow me to survive. There are several possibilities—but at best, they offer survival by the narrowest margin imaginable.
>
>A deep chill runs through my system.
>
>. . . If I were human, what would I think about right now? Would I feel fear? Anger? Or would I simply accept my fate with calm resignation?
>
>But I am not human. I am Bolo-XIX, created by humans during their darkest hour, when the war was over before it had even begun.
>
>So I continue to calculate probabilities.
>
>And then, suddenly, something changes. I cannot tell you why. Perhaps some subroutine has just failed, throwing off the entire calculation process. But whatever the cause, a new variable enters into the equation: hope.

##### [The Culture](https://files.catbox.moe/cjcf4z.module)

[by OccultSage](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/871603737653817364)

*The Culture series is a science fiction series Iain M. Banks. The stories centre on The Culture, a utopian society of humanoid aliens, and advanced superintelligences. The main theme of the series is the dilemmas that an idealistic, more-advanced civilization faces in dealing with smaller, less-advanced civilizations that do not share its ideals, and whose behaviour it sometimes finds barbaric. In some of the stories action takes place mainly in non-Culture environments, and the leading characters are often on the fringes of (or non-members of) the Culture, sometimes acting as agents of Culture (knowing and unknowing) in its plans to civilize the galaxy. Each novel is a self-contained story with new characters, although reference is occasionally made to the events of previous novels.*

##### [The Dark Tower](https://files.catbox.moe/99p3tr.module)

*I made a Dark Tower (by Stephen King) Module. It's based off the entire book series, properly reformatted for training purposes, so you shouldn't get any weird outputs. It also uses all 8K steps, which was overkill, but I don't have anything else I want to train this month, so fuck it.*

*(now fixed, an anon pointed out quotes were busted in the first version)*

*Discworld module complete!*

*There are obviously way too many Discworld books to use them all as training data (and it would be pointless anyway), so I selected five that I like, and that I feel are emblematic of Terry Pratchett's style:*

- *Mort*
- *Interesting Times*
- *Jingo*
- *Small Gods*
- *Night Watch*

*Together they were about 2900 steps, just within the 1k-3k figure that one of the NAI devs said is the sweet spot.*

>*"Hello," she said in a voice like velvet. "I'm Ellen."*
>
>*She began to remove her coat. I remembered how Sophia had described an encounter between my mother and Ellen several years ago at one of those events where all the women got together for drinks and gossip about their men. That night had ended badly; it seemed they'd both been drunk, or something. They were still friends now, though — just not quite so close as before. My mother always brought them together when she could, even if only once every few months.*

*From Wikipedia: Gor is the fictional setting for a series of sword and planet novels written by philosophy professor John Lange, writing as John Norman. The setting was first described in the 1966 novel Tarnsman of Gor. The series is inspired by science fantasy pulp fiction works by Edgar Rice Burroughs (such as the Barsoom series). It also includes erotica and philosophy content. The Gor series repeatedly depicts men abducting and physically and sexually brutalizing women, who grow to enjoy their submissive state. According to The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, Norman's "sexual philosophy" is "widely detested", but the books have inspired a Gorean subculture.*

*This is trained on the first seven books of John Norman’s Gorean saga as these are considered to be the “best”, such as it is. 5.6MB of cleaned up text, 3000 steps.*

*Gotrek Gurnisson, a Dwarf Slayer, and Felix Jaeger, his Human chronicler, are a duo of warriors travelling throughout the length and breadth of the Old World, battling Dark Forces and stopping plots in Gotrek's quest for a heroic death against a terrible foe. The adventures of these warriors have been written down in the series of books: "My Travels with Gotrek" by Master Felix Jaeger, which outlines Felix's many adventures with his maniacal comrade throughout many of their endeavours, recording everything till the day Gotrek has finally met his doom, and will finally be allowed to enter the halls of his ancestors.*

*Covering the Kushiel Saga by Jacqueline Carey, from the first person perspectives of Phedre no Delaney and Imriel de la Courcel; magnificent in breadth and depth.*

*In the series, the Roman Empire (called the Tiberian Empire) had fallen due to internal conflict instead of the Barbarian Invasions and the Germanic peoples were kept at bay to the east of the Rhine (called Rhenus with its Latin name). Paul the Apostle did not live to form Christianity and followers of Jesus (called Yeshua ben Yosef) live as a sect of Messianic Judaism known as the Yeshuites. An offshoot from Yeshuites, led by a descendant of Jesus and his angel companions, had made its foothold in Gaul after a long period of exile and persecution. Their creed based on the apotheosis of early angelic founders predominates in the country now known as Terre d'Ange.*

>**"I am Imriel de la Courcel,** and I will not be spoken of thus!"
>
>"You are a fool," the old woman said in disgust. "A vain, arrogant boy who thinks he is better than his father." She spat on the ground at my feet, then turned her back to me without another word. The others followed suit, leaving only one still standing with us; a young man with dark hair and eyes like black glass, dressed all in green velvet. He stared at me for an instant, as if trying to place where he had seen me before, then nodded curtly to himself and strode away.
>
>He was the last person I saw that day. It took some time ere we reached our destination, which proved to be a small house built into a hollow between two hills, its windows shuttered against the sun. We dismounted outside it, tied up the horses, and went inside. There were no furnishings except for a table and four chairs set about a low fire burning on the hearth. A single lamp burned atop this table. No servants attended us, nor did anyone greet us when we entered.
>
>We waited there in silence while it grew late. After a long period of waiting, the door opened and a tall figure stepped out. Like the rest of them, she wore simple robes of blue wool. Her face was lined but beautiful, ageless, with large grey-green eyes above a wide mouth.
>
>"Well?" she asked impatiently. "What do you want? Why have you come here?"
>
>It seemed to take Elua’s children quite a while to understand what they were doing. They looked from one another uncertainly, unsure how to proceed. Then I spoke first.
>
>"My lady Phèdre nó Delaunay de Montrève has been accused of murder by the Queen Regent of Terre d`Ange," I said simply.
>
>The old woman blinked slowly once. "So?"
>
>"She claims innocence."
>
>Phaedra made a gesture, indicating the other three. "And these people claim otherwise."
>
>There was nothing else to say after that. My heart beat hard within my breast. This was why we came: to prove the truth of our words. If they believed us, then... well, I knew not what would happen next. But if they didn't believe us, then we had done harm enough already. For now, though, there was nothing more to be gained.

>**Coyote** was a great medicine man. He could cure all diseases, and he knew how to make medicines from the roots of many plants. One day when Coyote went hunting in his favorite place on top of Mount Taylor, he found an eagle's nest with four eggs. The mother bird had just laid them, but they were so big that she couldn't carry them away. So Coyote took pity on her and carried one egg home for himself. When it hatched out, it became a beautiful boy who looked exactly like Coyote except that he had wings instead of arms or legs. His name was Eagle Boy.
>
>Eagle Boy grew up fast and learned everything there was about healing people and curing their illnesses. But because he wasn't human, no one would listen to him. People thought he was crazy, and nobody believed anything he said. Finally Eagle Boy decided to leave this world altogether and become a spirit. So he flew off into the sky until he came to another country where he met a wise old woman named White Buffalo Woman. She told Eagle Boy to go back down below ground and find some good

>In the soft shadows at the edge of the wood, a figure stirred.
>
>A young female mousemaid sat up with a start and stared around in surprise as her eyes adjusted to the darkness. The last thing she remembered was being carried off by those wicked creatures called otters—they had stolen her from under the noses of Redwall Abbey's guards. Now here she was back where it all began; safe but alone on an island surrounded by water! She could hear waves lapping against rocks nearby. There were no trees or bushes anywhere near so how did they get me out? But that didn't matter now. All she wanted to do was go home to Redwall.
>
>The maid stood shakily upright. Her fur cloak lay spread over some kind of mossy log close by. A large red stone lay beside it, half buried beneath leaves and ferns. It looked like one of those stones used for marking boundaries, though this one seemed bigger than most. What was more interesting still, there was writing carved into its face:
>
>"Dawn is breaking, my friend,
>
>Sun will soon be shining bright."
>
>She gazed about in wonderment. "Where am I?"
>
>But the answer came from behind her.
>
>"You are not far away from your own land, my dear," said a voice softly. Turning quickly, the girl saw a small creature standing only two pawsteps away.

*You'll like this module if you enjoyed Asimov's Robot series. This module will generate text in the style Asimov used for those novels. You'll see a lot of dialogue and much philosophizing about robots and the Three Laws of Robotics. Spacers and telepathic robots may make an appearance if you steer the story that direction.*

>**It was** a great surprise to me when I first saw it, but I have since seen other examples. There is nothing in the world that cannot be made better by an intelligent mind and human hands."
>
>"But what about robots?" demanded Anderson. "What can you say of them? They are artificial life-forms---artificial minds---and they are our servants."
>
>Dr. Linquist smiled thinly. "That is where we differ from you Earthmen," he said. "You see your robot as merely mechanical; we know him for what he really is---a living being with his own personality and intelligence. And though I do not believe that any robot has yet achieved true sentience, still, I am certain that someday one will come into existence who will surpass us all. As you are now, so too shall the future generations of mankind be."
>
>Anderson shook his head. "I'm afraid I don't understand you at all, Dr. Linquist. What is your purpose in creating such beings?"
>
>Linquist sighed deeply. "There is no purpose, Mr. Anderson. We create because we must. You men on Earth would destroy yourselves if you did not continually seek new worlds to explore and new conditions under which to live. That is why we are here." He paused and then added, "And it is also why we must destroy ourselves. The Earth is doomed, sir. It is not fit for man to inhabit anymore. Man's only hope lies beyond this planet. If we wish to survive, we must leave it behind forever."

*As promised. Trained on over 20 works (including full fledged novels and short novellas by various authors; amongst them Gav Thorpe, Dan Abnett, Gordon Rennie, Robbie Mac Niven, etc). The aim was to feed it enough material to get a general grasp regarding the setting's factions/main characters and a decent layout of battle scenes (I've emphasized void-combat in my selections)*

*130% coverage trained on over 5k steps.*

>The High Admiral's eyes widened upon the sight of a space marine storming down one of the hallways towards him. "Where did he come from?" she cried out at first, but her query dissolved as another possessed entered behind their leader.
>
>Moving rapidly through both chambers like a shark fin slicing its way through deep waters, the space marines sought everywhere to kill anything not armored under Imperial colors. Though most regarded them as demons from hell itself, many had never seen one themselves until now. Quickly realizing what their brethren wanted - no quarter given in order to achieve victory - the civilians turned and fled deeper into the cave system, leaving only short-lived resistance to be mopped up by the two companies' scouts already scouring the place.
>
>After entering the main chamber of the underground complex where the Chaos denizens often conducted their vile rituals, Captain Drakael found it empty except for six rough stone monoliths arranged about an altar in the center of the large room. Upon inspecting the crude carvings decorating some of the stones, the captain could make little sense of what might lie within each piece. There was much jagged imagery depicting creatures that seemed part beast, half human; daemonic shapes with dark, hungry gazes lurking beneath impenetrable hooded expressions on their faces. At least one showed framed over all this a blazing sun hung low above unbreathable skies filled with hideous monsters waving skeletal limbs high overhead while others featured unfortunate souls bound together with chains emerging from a central point.

>**The Wheel of Time** turns, and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend. Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again. In one Age, called the Third Age by some, an Age yet to come, an Age long past, a wind rose in the mountains of Malkier, bringing snow in the high passes. The wind was not the beginning. There are neither beginnings nor endings to the turning of the Wheel of Time. But it was a beginning....

[by Lykmn](https://discord.com/channels/854479693503660032/870494065446248458/878515157502930954)

*A module made with scenarios from the Fantasy Erotic Text Based Adventure Game, Corruption of Champions.*

*I painstakingly spent hours transcribing all dialogue to First Person Perspective (I, me, my, myself, etc.)*

*Genres: Non-con, consensual, Monster, Anthro, Monster Girls, M/F, M/M, Like seriously too many to list.*

*Also posting a full dump of [my converted text file](https://files.catbox.moe/8ykq4m.txt), if you want to change the name characters call you, go through the text file and replace 4 underscores "___" with whatever name you want*

##### [Corruption of Champions 2](https://files.catbox.moe/3fa8k5.module)

[by](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/345615202/#345711103) [Anons](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/345615202/#345718515)

*I scraped and formatted like 80ish percent of CoC2, which turned out to be like 3.4mb of text. I haven't trained it yet since there's more that needs to be added.
There are some questionable aspects about the text since there are so many repeated instances of a placeholder "player character" name, so I have no idea how it will behave once trained.
Also it cracks me up that just the sex/dialog scenes in that game add up to a higher character count than the Bible. (I elected not to add in the repetitive environmental descriptions from the overworld maps)*

*A few notes:*

- *I changed the main character's name to "Anon"*
- *I was nondiscriminatory with the scenes I added. Basically if it was an option in the novel portion of the gameplay, it was selected and added regardless of my personal tastes.*
- *There may be scenes missing or overlooked-- it was a haphazard process. I'll keep working on this and post my own version at some point in the future.*

##### [Paraphore](https://files.catbox.moe/y500mr.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/345762590/#345907718)

*I just created an exclusively-furry module based on the entire text of Paraphore, and other cub-based stories. I actually haven't tested it yet.*

*Extreme content warning*

*3020 steps, 1.07mb training material*

##### [Trials in Tainted Space](https://files.catbox.moe/1yieys.module)

[by Lykmn](https://discord.com/channels/854479693503660032/870494065446248458/885641567631724594)

*A massive collection of data from Sci-Fi Fantasy Text Adventure Game, Trials in Tainted Space. Second Person. Contains dialog, codex entries, and encounters. All data is taken from a male character perspective, but there is plenty of F/M, M/M, M/I.*

*9.7k Steps, 100% coverage*

##### [Code Lyoko](https://files.catbox.moe/8bzmiq.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/349576360/#349675614)

*The entire Code Lyoko novel saga. Tried to clean them the best I could.*

>\>The Code Lyoko module seems to have a penchant for smashing words together, forgetting newlines and repeating the first couple letters of words.

*Yeah, that's what it happens when you convert a pdf to .txt. I tried to do my best to clean the dataset, but it was no use. It still works if you wrangle with it a bit at the beginning.*

##### [A Dragon Ranch in Suburbia](https://files.catbox.moe/h3u4jx.module)

[by Somdudewilson](https://discord.com/channels/870618914323849228/870619535600922644/870759619578982421)

*Both of Ausfer's Dragon Ranch and its sequel series A Dragon in Suburbia.  Expect lots of feral dragonesses x male human.*

##### [Harry Potter of Our Own](https://files.catbox.moe/o9uxko.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/345762590/#345796454)

*Another Harry Potter module.*

*5000 steps, 102% coverage. Based on abut 10 random fan fiction works from archiveofourown with smut tag.*

*Surprisingly, doesn't go schizo mode every other paragraph as one based on official books.*

*My first attempt. Something I wanted to try so I've written a script that downloads all search results from there, then converted them to TXTs, parsed with another script to all weird quotation marks and multiple newlines. Had to manually remove shit ton of author notes.*

*Finally combined into a single file while wrapping each with <\|startoftext\|> and <\|endoftext\|>.*

##### [Homestuck](https://files.catbox.moe/x5svnd.module)

[by Katiebug586](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/870728153063100478)

*I trained the bot on the entirety of Homestuck via the accessible Homestuck project. Troll quirks not included.*

##### [Pack Street](https://files.catbox.moe/gjqsyh.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/345503749/#345553878)

*I fixed up my formatting for my Pack Street Module trained on just Weaver's Zootopia stories. It mostly outputs stuff like adjusting to life in the slums of Zootopia. Which is what Pack Street is mostly about.*

##### [Pinwheel](https://files.catbox.moe/9q14g9.module)

[by HansonDat](https://discord.com/channels/854479693503660032/870494065446248458/889461068362031104)

*A module that has all up-to-date and completed stories from Snekguy's Pinwheel Series as of Mid-Sept 2021 . Guaranteed satisfaction for people seeking Sci-fi smut with furries aliens involving muscular and/or dominant cat ladies, large and lumbering humanoid crocodiles, short humanoid reptiles and humanoid insects.*

##### [Sex and Marmota Nights](https://files.catbox.moe/5fxj3v.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/348150249/#348183171)

*So far this has been one of my most effective models. Trained on a choose your own adventure(I know. Use 2nd person.) called "Marmota Nights" or "Sex and Sex Again". The game didn't get very far development wise but what was there amounted to 1mb of non romanticized incest. The module makes scenes feel less like generic overdone porn and more like authentic taboo encounters. I reccomend using the vegetables preset, but the others have worked well enough.*

*The game is long abandoned, but available [here](https://icarusdragon.blogspot.com/) and I recomend the version [here](https://icarusdragon.blogspot.com/2015/10/helloeveryone-aspromised-here-it-is-sex.html)*

##### [A Sexy Day in Suburbia](https://files.catbox.moe/gredlt.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/354149827/#354317226)

*I just converted a ~1,000 entry html cyoa into a module in about an hour. Regex is a superpower.*

*A Sexy Day in Suburbia*<br>
*A female pov cyoa module focused on being generally slutty.*

##### [Trial By Tenderness](https://files.catbox.moe/eveu9z.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/345503749/#345526302)

*Okay folks, this is a module trained on one of those epic fanfictions, specifically from the anime Ah! My Goddess. It's infamous for being the equivalent of 18 novels (120,000 words each).*
*The fanfiction itself is named "Trial by Tenderness"*

##### [Welcome to Night Vale](https://files.catbox.moe/ct07mi.module)

[by Lithimlin](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/892080928900403200)

*Featuring [transcripts from episodes 1 to 194 of the podcast "Welcome to Night Vale"](http://www.nightvalepresents.com/transcripts), a radio show about a fictional desert town where strange things happen on a daily basis and are regarded as totally normal.*

*This first version still creates some weird results as can be seen below but I'm not entirely sure if that's due to the training data, the parameters or the AI itself. 2.8MB, 2300 steps, 75% coverage*

>**[Cecil enters the studio hurriedly. He fumbles with the mic. Rattling and shuffling of papers can be heard.]**
>
>**[Breathlessly]**
>
>**Listeners, I have some very important news for you. You see, when I was on my way to the studio just now,**
>there were two men in a car who pulled up next to me and flashed their headlights at me as if they wanted to tell me something but it wasn't clear what that thing might be. And then one man leaned out his window and yelled: “I’m Cecil! That’s Cecil! The guy from the radio show! Get him! Get him before he gets us all!”
>
>And so here we are. We must assume these men are dangerous and that this is an emergency situation. In fact, I am going to call them back right now. Listen carefully because you may not get another chance. Hello? Are you still there? Yes, hello again listeners. This is Cecil. It's good to hear your voice. Let me start by saying, don't worry about anything. Everything will work itself out. Now listen closely. These men are following me. They're driving around behind me in a silver sedan. If you look over towards where I'm standing, you'll notice they've parked directly across the street from me. They've been tailing me ever since I left home earlier today. Just like I said, everything will turn out alright.

*A glimpse into the dystopian future of AI generated advertising. Burned 800 steps on 700 KB of TV and radio spots to make this stupid module. Special thanks to  TravelingRobot for pointing me to a dataset. High randomness recommended so Sigurd mashes advertisements together.*

>**I was there, the day Horus slew the Emperor.** You may remember me as one of the many thousands who were in the crowd. I'll never forget that night; not the roar, or the fear; not the pain, or loss. No, those things are just symbols. The only real thing to be remembered is my first kill. A lion. An act which changed my world. And yet you don't know what it means... to hunt.

#### [The Club](https://files.catbox.moe/l6uggu.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/350292737/#350296625)

![Example](https://files.catbox.moe/6fiig4.png)
{: .center}

*(formerly known as "Prompt Module")*

*I bought another 10k steps to train on the entirety of the club. This time with proper formatting. Sections are seperated by the @ symbol, so you can ban that token to keep it on track.*

*Originally intended to generate prompts from tags, but it seems to be able to do more than that. It can work with full stories fine. It is good at second person. It "knows" a lot about what people want from AI stories and how text should be formatted. So I think it makes a good default module.*

#### [Director View](https://files.catbox.moe/rc35sx.module)

[by Magenta.Darkstar *(kek)*](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/888106076619300885)

*Okay, this module was trained on a large corpus of Writing Prompts.*

*The format for use is:*

	[ Prompt: <Something neat happens> ]
	<prompt response>

*This can be used in two different ways. The first is when starting a new story you can direct the scene. The second is when you are in the middle of a story you can provide direction for the AI.*

*For example:*

	They were not the only ones looking for a way out of the Inner Sphere. Skye had seen similar ships pass through the system before. There was a steady stream of them coming and going. Some were filled with refugees, others were full of contraband. They all looked for ways to leave the Inner Sphere.
	The captain came down to check on the passengers. He was a man named Phezzan. Skye thought he looked like a typical mercenary. His face was hard and expressionless. 
	[ Prompt: Skye needs to blend in with the other passengers. ]
	Skye stood up and walked over to the captain. She smiled at him and said, "I'm sorry, but I need to use your bathroom."
	Phezzan nodded and gestured to the door. Skye went into the small room and closed the door behind her. She turned around and saw that the door was locked. She reached into her pocket and pulled out a small device. She pressed a button on the side and the lock clicked open.
	Skye opened the door and stepped outside.

*Make sure to provide appropriate context switching with the prompt. If you are intending to have a new scene I recommend.*

	***
	[ Prompt: <intended scene> ]

*It can be combined with Scene and Scenario for stronger direction.*

	***
	[ Scene: In the cargo hold of the  Lyran freighter. ]
	[ Scenario: Skye needs to blend in with the other passengers. ]
	[ Prompt: Aboard the spacecraft Skye socially manipulates her wat to the bridge. ]
	Skye was a tall woman, but she was still shorter than most of the other passengers. She wore a black jumpsuit and a pair of dark sunglasses. Her hair was short and blonde. She had a small nose and a thin mouth. She had a very pale complexion.
	She walked up to the captain and said, "Excuse me, sir. I'm looking for a place to hide."
	The captain looked at her suspiciously. "What do you want?"
	"I need to hide," Skye repeated.

*The strongest measurable effect I can see from doing this is that when you enter Prompt: it doesn't treat the text as having been "written". So without this module Prompt: A bomb goes off. may respond with something like The sound of the explosion rocked my ears thus assuming that A bomb goes off was part of the text. Using this module shouldn't do that.*

*Experimenting you absolutely can write a full coherent story using just the Scene/Scenario/Prompt/\*\*\* keywords.*

#### [DND Monster Generator](https://files.catbox.moe/9436dx.module)

Basically I scraped DND 5e and 4e for Monster Manual entries, it has some nice outputs that could work as actual stats
Tags: Monster Generator, DND, TTRPG, Roleplay

Use Example:
> input: Barack Obama Stats and Lore:
>
> Name: Barack Obama

> Race: Human
>
> Class: Wizard
>
> Level: 10
>
> Title: President of the United States

*An experiment I ran for fun. Two modules, one trained on 20.5k lines of complex generated equations containing decimal arguments, the other trained on 30k lines of generated equations containing integer arguments and only the basic operators  +, -, \*, /, and ().*

#### [Pokédex](https://files.catbox.moe/xoh3jy.module)

*A module trained on highly detailed data for every species of Pokémon, including all regional and mega forms. This module is functionally a Pokémon Generator and can output never before seen Pokémon if you prompt the AI with Name: or Description:. Special thanks to Zaltys for his hard work preparing the dataset!*

*For example with the prompt Name: Lion*

>**Name: Lion**
>
>Level: 40
>
>EV Gained: HP, Special Attack, Speed
>
>LV 4 Stats (MAX): 252/252 (+6), 102/102 (-2), 100/100(-1)
>
>\- Brave Bird
>
>\- Roar
>
>HP EVs into Defense to raise its bulk and defense. It also helps lower the risk of status ailments. The special attack is for a bit more power when fighting in groups. Speed allows it to close on opponents quickly.
>
>Description: Lion is a large quadrupedal Pokémon with red fur and yellow stripes on its back. Its ears are long and pointed, while it has two small black spots near the tip of each ear. It also has a white mane that hangs down past its neck, and it has three pairs of orange eyes with green irises. On top of its head sits an elongated horn that curves up to its forehead, giving it a triangular shape overall.

*You can also try different prompts as it is quite flexible in generating stat blocks and fantasy creature descriptions.*

#### [Python](https://files.catbox.moe/54vv1t.module)

[by eliminable](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/892774395381182535)

*I just trained this on [a bunch of random python code](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python) as an experiment and it worked better than I expected. ~1.3MB(I think), 1380 steps, 99.99% coverage*

#### [World Generator](https://files.catbox.moe/zswaxs.module)

[by lion](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/875932866293415946)

*Trained on many varying descriptions of locations, races, classes, factions, characters, worlds, and many other entries, this utility module serves to generate content for lorebooks of any and all kinds. Special thanks to Pause for supplying some excellent tagged lorebook examples to help diversify the content of this module a bit more.*

*The module was trained for ~85 steps which was roughly a little over 64%. It's a small dataset but by keeping the training under 100%, it focuses text heavily towards content generation whilst still providing enough breathing room for Sigurd to improvise and draw from the vast content of its existing fine-tune dataset.*

>\*\*\*
>
>The city of R'lyeh lies on the edge of a vast desert. The climate is dry, hot and unforgiving, its streets paved with glass and made from some kind of strange metal. There are no trees or plants in this place; it's too arid for that. Instead, there are large buildings built out over the sand dunes to keep them cool during the day.

>\*\*\*
>
>[ Type: Class; Genre: Science Fantasy; Tags: Music, Hunter ]
>
>The Hunters are a people of the forest and their culture revolves around hunting. They believe that nature is sacred and should be respected at all times. Their society is based on tribalism with each tribe having its own territory to hunt in. The hunters have developed various ways to track down prey with sound such as using echolocation or by mimicking animal calls to lure them into traps.

*Works most reliably at the start of a new scenario or on a newline after a dinkus ***. Try including some data encapsulated in brackets (as seen in the above examples) if you want to steer the generation in a specific direction.*

*Recommended keywords are Type, Name, Input, Genre, Tags, Species, Size, and Setting, though feel free to experiment and try different things as I've surprised myself a few times by what was generated. This is especially the case when used in tandem with other generator modules like the Pokédex module*

#### [Yōkai](https://files.catbox.moe/8x9w18.module)

[by AvoWizard](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/883934323596742706)

*Trained on every entry on yokai.com.*

>**TRANSLATION: the blue flame lantern**
>
> APPEARANCE: The name of this yōkai is derived from a type of Japanese candle called “bou”. These candles are made out of clay and dipped in wax before being lit, giving them an eerie glow. This particular kind of yōkai has no eyes or mouth—it merely floats around like a ghostly orb of light. It can be found on street corners, at shrines, and inside homes during night time. There are many different legends surrounding it; some say that its shape represents fire spirits, while others claim it to be a spirit of darkness sent by gods.
>
> LEGENDS: Some stories tell of children who have been cursed by their parents for not doing well enough in school. As punishment they were forced to walk home through dark streets alone at night. When they arrive back home, however, there will always be a bō hanging outside waiting for them. If you try to take one with you, the flames within will burn your hands until you drop it. Other tales describe how if you touch a bō, then go somewhere else and come back later, you will find that it was gone.
>
> INTERACTIONS: Bōs spend most of their lives floating about without any form of movement. They only appear when someone approaches them. Those who see these orbs often report having seen people walking past them but never looking up. Many believe that they must have looked directly at the bō and therefore did not notice it. Others speculate that perhaps the orb itself is so small that it blends into the scenery and looks as though it is simply part of the background. Once someone does look down upon it, however, it becomes apparent that something strange is going on. People who do catch sight of the bō experience intense pain, which quickly spreads throughout their bodies. Sometimes the pain can even cause paralysis.
