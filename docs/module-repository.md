# The Rent-Free Module Repository
{: .center}

Well, looks like we've run out of space on the [rentry](https://rentry.co/modules).
{: .center}

Thus the repo continues here, where character limit concerns are a thing of the ~~past~~ distant future. If and when another model comes out, I'll backup this edition to it's own page and start from the rentry.co anew.

*Trained on 21 of Beatrix Potter's children's stories. Expect Victorian era, United Kingdom, countryside living with talking animals and (surprisingly dark) plotlines.*

*215kb, 246 steps, 100% coverage, 2.775 loss*

>**Mrs. Tabitha Twitchit is a cat who lives in a countryside cottage with her three kittens, Tom, Moppet, and Mittens. She enjoys sitting on the hearth and listening to the fire crackle.** Her favourite pastime is telling stories about her adventures when she was a kitten. One day Mrs. Twitchit comes across some mice who have built their home under the floorboards of her cottage. The mice are trying to steal from her pantry but they find themselves trapped in a trap set by Mrs. Twitchit herself. When the mice promise not to tell anyone else about what happened, Mrs. Twitchit decides to let them go free. However, as soon as they leave the house she sets her traps again and catches another group of mice.
>
>Mrs. Twitchit is quite a nimble cat and very good at catching mice. In fact, so good is she that even other cats begin to fear her. But Mrs. Twitchit does not care. She continues to catch mice, trapping them in jars and bottles, until one day a large black rat arrives at her door. He tells her that he has been sent by the King himself to warn her that if she doesn't stop chasing him and his friends around her garden, then they will be forced to come up with an invention which will make her life miserable.

[10K Step V3 Sigurd Vers.](https://mega.nz/file/9W4EVD7Y#zlX2DM6Ypf-QHYet2JoUeUJ7neLeVdniseEYxvSo48c)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/359155218/#359498762)

*LewisAnon here. I've just retrained my CS Lewis module for Sigurd V4, haven't had much time to test it yet, but it's working.*

*Training data was all of the major fiction works:*

- *Narnia (7 books)*
- *Space Trilogy (3 books)*
- *The Screwtape Letters*
- *The Great Divorce*
- *Pilgrim's Regress*
- *Til We Have Faces: A Myth Retold*

*Plus a small amount of non-fiction:*

- *Mere Christianity*
- *The Four Loves*
- *The Weight of Glory*

*I had about 2000 steps left over that I could have used to include more of his non-fiction books, but I was concerned that including too much of it would drown out the fiction in terms of effect on the AI's output. I might try a fiction-only version next month when my steps reset.*
*The results seem pretty great so far, better than I expected. Let me know how you get on with it.*

*I've made a module that no one asked for and probably no one wants. It's trained on the detective mystery/comedy novels written by and starring Kinky Friedman and his cat.*

*It has a tendency towards non-nonsensical dialog, inner monologues, and metaphors. [The screenshot](https://files.catbox.moe/m3ilvh.png) is on a completely empty prompt. Results are slightly less nonsensical when used with an actual prompt*

#### [Rod Serling](https://files.catbox.moe/azd2eq.zip)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/359155218/#359495805)

*The Rod Serling module. Trained on:*

- *Stories from the Twilight Zone*
- *More Stories from the Twilight Zone*
- *New Stories from the Twilight Zone*
- *Night Gallery*
- *Night Gallery 2*

*Those were the only ones I could find easily. I think The Season To Be Wary would've fit in well as well, but I couldn't find it. Maybe that's for V2 of the model, if that will become a thing. Anyway, I decided to include all my files with the module, so you get the original ebooks I used, the original parsing in plaintext that Pandoc made, and my final edited text files that I used for the training. Maybe it's interesting for someone to see how the module was made. Note: I had an ebook that combined the three Twilight Zone books into one, so there's three ebooks in total.*

[by](https://rentry.co/Jungshit) [Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/357586350/#357604959)

*Here's the Jung module, I would have liked to test it more but life got in the way.*

*Since it is trained mostly on data from his seminars (And the rest formatted to look like it is) your writing should follow a specific script format, which the AI works with quite well.*

*I included [the seminar-like scenario](https://anonfiles.com/Z5s3U3Qdud/The_Seminar_scenario) I made to playtest it, no guarantee that it is optimal and fiddling is encouraged.*

*Worst case in scenario Jung and the other people present will tell you they have no idea what the dream or vision you showed them means, a majority of the time they will shed some light on it but mostly ask you what you think, and some percentage of the time they will expand appropriately on the symbols. If you handhold it at first it works better.*

*It also doesn't have to be about dreams at all, there's data for interpreting poems, aphorisms, intrusive thoughts, fetishes, and basically anything, though you might have to reformat the scenario to make it fit.*

*I also included [the training data](https://anonfiles.com/V7qdU5Q6u5/Jung2_txt) in case you want to know the format to follow or whatever. The works included are in the module's description.*

*Big thanks to OccultSage for his advice on data formatting and for training the module.*

>The moment she opened the door to her apartment, a wave of heat and light hit her. The sun was setting behind the building across from hers, but it still managed to illuminate everything inside. She could see every detail in the room: the bare white walls; the kitchen counter with its old-fashioned wooden cabinets; the framed poster on the wall that said "I My Mom." It had been there for as long as she'd lived here—she remembered when she'd gotten it at an art fair downtown. A small smile played over her lips. She loved this place. This neighborhood. And most importantly, she loved her mom.

>She walked into the living room and dropped her bag by the couch. Her mother's voice came through the open window.

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/348541970/#348588994)

*Anyone here into any of the stuff Joe Forest writes? He's the dude that made the SLUT Academy HTML/Twine game if you're familiar with that. It's pretty degenerate shit TF, preg, bestiality, MTF, Even weirder TF like vaginas turning into their canine equivalents, but I figure someone here is as depraved as I am.*

*I trained a Novel AI module with all of his stuff, including his HTML games. Though I left out Lost Property, and his RPGM game.*

*I haven't done much to test if it works all that great or not, but I had the AI write out some terms and character descriptions of things/people that are in the stories to see if it caught on to some of it. For the most part, they seem to be somewhat close to what they are in the stories, with some obvious AI weirdness mixed in. Some of them can be hit or miss though. I think it's dependent on how long a given story is and how much a given term appears in it. So it failed on some obscure ones, but also got some of them pretty close. It's hit or miss.*

*I'm not really sure how well it does at writing smut yet in an actual story, but for what it's worth, I pressed enter on a blank prompt and it went head first into generating a sex scene.*

*I'm new to training the AI though, so I only went for 100% of the training (so about 1500 steps), I don't really know if that's enough or not.*

*A couple threads late but I figured I'd share my SlutWriter module trained at 100% with 8855 steps. I'm not the one who made the original, but it inspired me to make one with the extra steps I had lying around. Barring those he deleted over the years and some stories I had to trim due to weird formatting/similar content, I crammed the training data with almost all of SlutWriter's works from HF and Ao3. Each piece was individually cleaned up with Notepad++.*

*I've been testing it with CC, Best Guess, and Experimental Moth and so far it seems to cover all topics pretty well imo. Especially the more debauched ones, which was my primary objective.*

> Gwen felt her stomach flip, her face flush as her breasts swelled with her arousal. With her spider-sense screaming bloody murder, Gwen's mind flashed back to the dogs' earlier display of aggression. They were clearly not going to play nice. Gwen knew her only choice was to fight her way free of her predicament, but her body betrayed her as her legs wobbled and her knees buckled in surrender.
>
> The pack surrounded her, jostling her with their musk as her bodysuit became soiled with their drool and cum. The stench of the feral animals filled her nostrils as they rubbed their cocks all over her body, smearing their foul bodily fluids on every inch of exposed skin. Their hot, rancid breath washed her in waves of putridity as they sniffed her crotch and her armpits, their tongues slithering across her thighs and up her inner arms. Gwen's heart raced as her bodysuit became soaked with their excretions, her senses overwhelmed by the sheer volume of their pheromones.
>
> Gwen felt her pussy moisten as she realized her nipples were tingling, her panties becoming saturated with her own juices as the animals pressed their roving cocks against her bare chest, their dicks surging with the desire for breeding. She was now trapped in a nightmare of her worst fears, the dogs running her down until they had her on the ground, their massive bodies pinning her down as they surged closer and closer, their cocks dripping pre-cum onto her bodysuit, their filthy paws pawing at her tits and cunt. Gwen's eyes grew distant as she pondered her fate, her body betraying her as her fingers dug into the pavement, her waist bending backward as her ass rose off the ground.

> The Klithian smiled cruelly as you stared blankly in response to your captor. The reptile's long snout curled upward as the digits of one of her hands traced a line along the length of your shaft through your pants. Your hips twitched as an involuntary moan escaped your lips.
>She chuckled again, "I can see you yearn for my touch. Perhaps I should show you just what you've been missing..."
>
> With a flick of the wrist the captain tossed aside your clothes, revealing a pair of pale white legs and a toned, muscular torso. As the garment fell to the floor the Klithian's eyes widened and she leaned in, pressing a soft and warm kiss to the side of your neck. The sensation was electric as the reptilian tongue flicked out to taste your flesh. The two-handed grip on your neck tightened as the Klithian pressed herself against you. The fingers of her other hand dug deep into your ass, squeezing tightly as they glided up your spine, past your shoulders, and across your scalp. Your head lolled backward as the beast feasted on the tender meat of your neck, licking and sucking with a hunger that matched yours.
>
> Your vision blurred as the Klithian's tongue invaded your mouth, forcing you to submit and accept its caresses. You moaned into its embrace, the alien's slimy appendage stroking and probing your eager throat. The feeling of helplessness was overwhelming, the sudden desire to be dominated almost too much for you to handle. The reptilian's constricting grasp on your neck was the only thing keeping you from surrendering completely to her. The scent emanating from her loins filled your nostrils and drove you wild – a musky aroma that was intoxicating.

>This grimoire was discovered by a curious Khajiit named Rijja while digging through the ruins of an ancient ruin near Lion's Arch. She claimed to have stumbled upon it while searching for some missing scrolls. The book itself has been well preserved, though its pages are covered in strange writing. Rijja claims she could not understand a word of it, but it seems as if someone else may have had the same problem.

>"That's what I heard too," the Argonian replied. He took a long pull on his ale skin and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand. "It's not right," he continued. "The Emperor should be meeting us in battle, not sending these cowards to fight our battles for him!"

>
>"We have to go," she said urgently. "The city is in chaos! They've already begun looting and rioting, and there are people everywhere! We need to help them."

>
>Aliapoh didn't need any further encouragement to hurry along after the other two keepers who had gone ahead earlier in the day. They were all old men—the youngest was nearly seventy years old himself! And yet their bodies still moved like boys half their age with energy enough to rival a hatchling dragonet. It made no sense.

>**The roar of the engine** filled his ears. He could hear nothing else, not even his own thoughts. The sound was like a beast snarling and growling as it came closer to him.
>
>He was moving again, he realised suddenly. He was on his feet, running for all he was worth. There were no lights in sight now. His eyes had adjusted to the dark and he could see nothing but the road ahead. He ran across the desert floor, trying to put some distance between himself and whatever was chasing him.
>
>His lungs burned with the effort. It seemed that he would never be able to catch his breath. But then he saw something looming up in front of him. A large shape blocking out the stars.

>**The sand beneath my feet** was hot and dry, the wind whipping at me. I was tired from the journey, but my mind was racing with thoughts of revenge. The last time we had met, he had taken a piece of my soul. He would pay for that now. I ran across the sand towards him, knowing what was about to happen. I knew that once I got close enough, he'd kill me.
>
>I heard his voice before I saw him. "Come on then, you little bitch," he shouted as he started running towards me. I could hear his heavy breathing and the pounding of his feet against the sand. I didn't stop or turn around. I just kept going straight ahead. When he reached me, I jumped up and kicked him in the face. His head snapped back and blood flew out from his nose. He fell backwards onto the ground and I landed on top of him. I pulled one of my knives from its sheath and held it to his throat.

>"Where's your fucking water?" I screamed at him. He tried to say something, but all that came out was a bloody gurgle.

>**Reimu turned to face the path in front of her shrine, seeing the silhouette of a youkai she knew very well slowly emerge from the stone stairs leading up towards it: “Oho!” The figure had long blonde hair cascading all over her frame and a smug smile on her face. It was unmistakeably Yukari Yakumo,** who always managed to appear whenever something bad happened in this world. And now here she stood right outside Reimu's home. This would normally mean trouble, but since today wasn't even Sunday yet... Well, as far as Reimu could remember, Yukari never came anywhere near her house before noon. Not only did she want some time away from everyone else, she didn't seem interested in causing any more problems than necessary either. So Reimu decided to give her space while still keeping an eye out for what might happen next. As soon as she saw the girl stop walking though, Reimu couldn't help herself anymore: “So? What brings ya back here so early?"
>
>"Well I suppose we should get straight into why I'm really here..." Yukari said with another grin as she walked through the shrine's gate. In spite of everything that they'd been through together during their friendship, there were times when Yukari seemed like such a little brat that Reimu just wanted to smack her upside the head.

>**The blade slashed through the air, as the girl danced** around him. She was a lithe creature of sinuous grace and perfect beauty, her eyes bright with an inner fire that burned like stars in dark night skies. Her hair hung down over one shoulder in two thick braids that reached to below her waist; it shone with glints of gold and silver. In the shadows she looked more than human, but he knew better. A part of his mind noted that the tips of her pointed ears were tipped by tiny slivers of horn. The rest of his mind was lost in lust for this dangerous toy. He watched her move through the dance as if it were all choreographed. Her movements had a natural fluidity that spoke of long practice and skill. His own body moved almost without thought, matching hers in rhythm, while his hands traced patterns on the air as if guided by another's will. And then...
>
>She came at him suddenly, lunging forward into a sudden lunge that ended in a kick aimed directly at his groin. With practiced ease he shifted to block her blow, and caught her leg in mid-swing. Before she could recover from her attack, he dropped low and wrapped both arms around her waist. She struggled briefly, trying to twist free, but found herself trapped between his chest and the wall behind him. She kicked out desperately, but her foot only grazed his ribs before she was pulled back against his body. Her head lolled loosely against his shoulder, her hair tickling his cheek.

>**I am a Templar of the Queen**'s Guard. I will not be afraid. She has seen me and knows what I am. The first time she saw me, she was but five years old. Now she is grown into womanhood, with all her powers. And yet she still fears me; for she sees in my eyes that which no one else can see. It is only by chance that I have found her at this moment. Had it been any other time, I might never have known where to find her. Even now, had I not met you on the road, I would not know how to reach her. But here we are together, and soon she will be safe from those who seek to destroy her.

>"You have heard of Agenor?" he asked. "He is a great sorcerer, as well as an evil man."
>
>She nodded. "But I do not understand why they fear him so much."
>
>"Agenor is dangerous," said the giant warrior. "His power is great. He has made himself mighty among men."
>
>"But surely his magic cannot harm us!" she exclaimed.
>
>"No, but there are others who might," he replied grimly. "The demons who live in the deep places of the earth may be summoned up to destroy us. Or Agenor might summon them himself."

##### [World of Pokémon](https://files.catbox.moe/ffc4y9.module)

[by lion](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/360670534/#360830524)

*As with v1, this module is trained on similar adventure series, literary RPGs, nature books, and other resources that have been 'Pokémonized' to match the names, abilities, rules, and other aspects of the Pokémon universe.*

*Version 2 is better cleaned and pruned with a focus on quality over quantity.*

*I removed the Jim Butcher (Furies of Calderon) books and the Lucy Cooke one as they were too stylistically different even with the changes to names and terms. I also further cleaned up the Djinn Tamer series and some others and tried to better balance out the usage of Pokémon content. The dataset is otherwise the same.*

*As a result, battles (especially tournaments) are a lot more common, as is Pokémon being associated with Pokéballs. I think this version is a lot stronger, and while I'll continue to look for ways to improve upon it, I feel a lot more confident with this than I did with v1. Let me know what you think!*

> It's a little over an hour before the tournament is set to begin. The gym has been cleaned and organized, with tables in place for all of the trainers and a podium ready for any announcements. I'm standing at the front of the room next to Professor Pepper, who's dressed in her usual black lab coat. She looks exhausted, but happy that she got through another day. Her eyes are heavy, like they've seen far too much over the past few days.
>
> I glance around the room as people start trickling in. There are maybe thirty or so trainers here today, which isn't surprising considering how many were in the last group. A lot of them have Pokémon that are clearly stronger than mine. Some even have two or three of them! My confidence wavers slightly.
>
> "All right everyone," Professor Pepper says from behind me. "We're going to get started in just a moment."

> After a few minutes of training, Vic left to get ready for her match. "I'm going to go shower and change," she said, getting up from her chair. She was about to walk out the door when Emmit stopped her.
>
> "You don't have to do that," he said, pointing at Vic's Poke-balls. "They're not like your Pokémon — they'll be fine."
>
> "It doesn't matter," she said. "I've been living with these creatures since I was four years old. They're my life."
>
> Vic walked over to the table where the Poke-balls were lined up next to each other. One of them was different from the others: it was a green ball with black lines around it. Vic picked it up and tossed it into her bag.
>
> "I'm bringing Banette with me anyway," she said, walking back towards the door. "She's my partner. She can take care of me if anything happens."
>
> Emmit nodded as Vic walked out of his room.

> **Wandering through the tall grass,** I saw a group of three Pokémon standing around something in the middle. A small human boy stood beside them, holding out his hand as he pointed to one of the Pokémon. It was an Onix that looked like it had been digging up dirt and throwing rocks for fun. The other two were a pair of Pidgey, flapping their wings and squawking at each other.
>
> "Hello," I said as I approached them. "Do you mind if I take a look?"

> **I hear a screech and suddenly a group of** four Hariyama are charging at me. I leap to the side, dodging their claws as they try to get around my left flank. I'm not sure what I can do against them with my own Pokémon but I don't have time to think about it now. They're fast, but not nearly as quick as my Arcanine. As one of the Hariyama gets close enough to attack, I order Arcanine to use its Quick Attack on him while I throw a Fire Stone in his direction. The Hariyama lets out an angry roar and leaps away from me.
>
>"That's two down!" I shout as I check my map for more enemies. "Let's keep going."
>
> We continue through the jungle until we reach another clearing where there is a small stream running across our path. There's a bridge that leads over the water and beyond it, I see the faint outline of a building surrounded by trees. It looks like a temple or something similar, but I can't be sure because the light is too dim to make anything out clearly.
>
> "Should we rest here?" I ask Treyni.
>
> She shakes her head. "No, we need to find the way inside before nightfall."

*Note: These examples were done on an otherwise new vanilla scenario (default settings, no bias, lorebooks, or anything) however I do recommend using [Loki's Pokédex phrase bias](https://rentry.co/biases#pokedex) or an otherwise similar bias to help reinforce Pokémon appearance, etc.*

>**She peeked from the palanquin,** watching as her escort led them to a small temple. The priestess of Kali stood outside, hands folded in supplication. A few other women were already there, kneeling before the goddess's image. Some of them were weeping.
>
>"Are they going to sacrifice us?" asked Megha. "We should run."
>
>Priya shook her head. "They're praying for mercy."
>
>Megha looked skeptical.
>
>The priestess bowed low before entering the temple. She held up one hand in prayer and began to sing. Priya felt the sound vibrate through her body, deep within her bones. It was a song of longing, a song of yearning.

>**He drew his dagger** and held it up in the air. It was a silver blade, old as time itself, with runes etched into its surface that glowed like fireflies trapped inside of glass. He had no idea what they meant; he'd never bothered to learn their meaning. But he knew this much: it would cut through anything—even solid stone—as if it were butter on a hot griddle. Once upon a time, he could have used such a weapon even without knowing how.
>
>Now... not so much. His arm ached where the wound from the manticore's fang still lingered. The magic within him felt sluggish now, too weak to heal himself or anyone else. Even Kale couldn't help but feel it. They all did.

>"I'm sorry," said Arwa. "It wasn't my—"

>**The mermaid sang upon the rocks,** her voice a thin silver thread that wound around them all. The water lapped against their feet and she looked up at the stars with wide green eyes. She was very beautiful. Her hair fell like seaweed down to her waist, black as night itself. A faint glow lit her pale skin, as if moonlight shone through her from behind. And then the sea swallowed her again, leaving only bubbles on the sand.
>
>"She's gone," said Alberic softly. He looked over his shoulder at the others. "What do you say?" he asked the sailors. They murmured in agreement.
>
>They turned back toward home.

>**The witch was mercurial and beautiful** as she laughed, her eyes flashing in the firelight. "I have a plan," she said, pulling me close to her again. Her lips brushed my ear, making it tingle. She whispered, "If I kill you now..."
>
>"You'll be sorry?" I finished for her.
>
>She smiled. "Yes."
>
>We were silent then, listening to the crackle of flames. The room was still and warm with the heat from our bodies; only a faint draft moved through the open window. My mind began racing, trying to figure out how I could escape this woman's clutches. I couldn't just leave Cook behind--the witch would know that. But if I killed her, I'd have no chance of getting back into the palace without being caught myself. And what about Cook? What if she woke up before we got away?
>
>But there was nothing else to do but wait and hope. We sat together on the edge of the bed, leaning against each other like two lovers sharing secrets. I felt dizzy and sick, wishing I had something stronger than wine to drink. The witch seemed to sense my weakness; she stroked my hair and murmured words of comfort. "Shh," she said, kissing me lightly on the forehead. "Don't worry, little one. You're safe here."
>
>My eyes closed; I lay back against her chest, feeling strangely calm. Perhaps she could help me after all. I fell asleep, and when I woke again, it was morning.

>I opened my eyes slowly, wondering where I was.

>The old man was sitting in a corner of his room, listening to the ticking of the clock and looking at the closed door through which the other two had gone. The old man listened with interest: there were voices beyond that door; he could hear them talking softly, as if they did not wish to be overheard. And then suddenly all three voices ceased. He heard footsteps approaching along the corridor, and presently he saw the door open.

>**She rode, and rode after the love of her life.** She had to find him. Had to make sure he was okay. But she could not stop thinking about what had happened between them that night. What it meant. And how much more there was for both of them.
>
>"I am a fool," she said aloud as she rode into town behind the stagecoach. "A stupid, blind fool."
>
>The day before yesterday she had been in San Francisco. She had thought only one thing then: to get away from Jake Morgan. Now she wanted nothing but to see him again. To tell him everything.
>
>And to feel his arms around her once more.
>
>Her hands were shaking when she reached the hotel where he worked as a clerk. The man who came out to greet her was dressed in a fine suit with a white shirt and bow tie. He looked like any other clerk, but something told her this man was no ordinary employee.
>
>He took one look at her face and his eyes widened. "Miss Gentry?"
>
>"Yes." She dismounted and handed the reins to the young boy who had brought up the coach. Then she walked toward him.
>
>His voice dropped low when he spoke. "I'm sorry I wasn't here yesterday. We got held up by some drunks on the road. They attacked us and we barely escaped with our lives."
>
>She nodded. "I know. My friend told me."
>
>He smiled. "You're lucky to have such good friends."

>She turned to gaze at the hotel. Her room was upstairs. "Outside. Please."

>**The woman stood before the samurai proudly and yelled, "Go ahead, kill me! Take away the stain of dishonor on my family I am!"** She was not afraid.
>
>"Stop this nonsense," said Hideyoshi impatiently. "You are a beautiful woman." He smiled at her with his warmest smile. Her eyes widened in surprise, but she did not stop shouting.
>
>"I have never been so insulted by any man! I am a member of the Ashikaga family, and you dare to say that I am beautiful?"
>
>Hideyoshi's smile broadened into a grin. "It is true. You are beautiful. But your beauty has nothing to do with it. If you were ugly, would I be saying these things? Would anyone listen if I told them how pretty you are?" The woman stopped yelling and stared at him in amazement.
>
>"Listen carefully," he continued, looking directly into her eyes. "Your name is Lady Naka no Kimi. Your husband died last year. Now you are all alone, living with your two children."
>
>Naka looked down at the ground. Then suddenly she lifted her head and shouted, "Yes, I am alone. My husband left me for another woman. But I still love my dead husband. Do you understand? And I will always remember him as long as I live."
>
>Hideyoshi nodded sympathetically. "That is good. I know what you mean. Even though you loved your husband, he abandoned you when you needed him most. But don't worry. There is someone who loves you now. Someone who wants to help you. Will you let him?"
>
>Naka shook her head vigorously. "No, I won't. I cannot allow such a thing. It is too late. My life is over."
>
>"Don't be so sure. Listen to me. You must make up your mind. Either you will accept this person's offer or you will die."
>
>Naka stood there silently. Her face was red with anger. Suddenly she turned around and ran away from Hideyoshi.

>**The ronin's hand hovered on the handle of his sheathed katana,** then he shook himself and went inside. The heavy wooden door creaked shut behind him with a thud that seemed to echo in the stillness. He could hear no sound from above or below. But there was something else—a smell, faint but unmistakable: blood.
>
>"I'm home." Yoshi walked across the room. "Is anyone here?" His voice echoed hollowly in the silence. There was no answer. With a sigh he sank into one of the tatami mats and sat cross-legged, gazing at nothing. For several minutes he said nothing more. Then he heard footsteps descending the stairs. A moment later, Taro appeared in the doorway.
>
>Yoshi stood up quickly. "What happened? Is anything wrong?"
>
>Taro nodded slowly. "Yes. Your father is dead."
>
>"Dead! How?" Yoshi felt as though someone had hit him hard between the eyes. He swayed slightly.
>
>"He died peacefully last night," Taro said gently. "Your mother was beside herself with grief when she learned about it this morning. She wanted you to come home immediately."
>
>Yoshi closed his eyes tightly for a second, then opened them again. "Did they say how he died?"
>
>"No. Only that he died suddenly, without warning. No one knows why. It appears he suffered a stroke."
>
>Yoshi stared blankly at the floor. For several seconds he remained motionless, not speaking. Finally, he raised his head and looked directly at Taro.

*Journeys between stars across multiple generations at slower than light! Some are escaping a doomed Earth, others have forgotten that they are generation ships, and further, society breaks down; a few are grand odysseys in the hard scifi tradition.*

>**The generation ship Odysseus burned for the stars, its giant fusion torch pushing it as close as possible to lightspeed,** so that the years would pass in mere months. The crew was already selected and trained by the time they left Earth orbit, with only a few weeks of training before departure. They had all grown up together, most having gone through school and college together. Most were married or engaged, but no one seemed particularly upset when their friends or relatives decided not to go along on this voyage.
>
>In fact, there wasn't much of an argument about leaving Earth at all. Everyone knew that the Odysseus could never return home; it was designed to be a one-way trip. The planet's biosphere had been destroyed by nuclear war long ago, and there was no chance of finding another suitable world within the solar system where humans could live safely. So why not take off for the stars? It was better than dying in a radioactive wasteland.

>**The generation ship's fusion engines burned as it consumed hydrogen, and it maneuvers towards the Sun for a gravity-assisted boost closer to the speed of light, its passengers in cryogenic suspension and insulated from the effects of the hard acceleration.** The fusion engine is burning so hot that it has melted some of the nickel-iron core material into liquid metal. It flows through pipes inside the ship and then back out again, radiating heat like a giant radiator.
>
>On board the planetoid they call Bussard's Viewing Room, I'm sitting at my desk in front of the window, looking down on the tiny red dot that is our home world. A small robot arm with a stylus attached to it extends from the wall behind me and makes an erratic scratching motion across the screen, which changes every few seconds. On another monitor, a view of Earth shows the same thing happening there. I've been watching this show for years now, ever since we were all woken up by the crew waking us from suspended animation.

>**The light of the blue star beat down on Alexandria's head, as she bent over the relic that her crew had dug out in the pit.** She wore a heavy helmet and goggles, but even so it was uncomfortably hot. The metal of the digging tools was already glowing red-hot under its sunlamps. They would need to cool before they could be used again.
>
>"It looks like an old robot," Alex said. "But there's no way we can tell what kind."
>
>A robot? That didn't make sense. Robots were built by humans; if this thing was human, then it must have been made by something else entirely. But she couldn't imagine who or what. It certainly wasn't anything from Earth. And it wasn't even possible for them to send a message back home—not with their radio damaged.
>
>Alex straightened up and wiped sweat off her brow with one gloved hand. "We'll have to take it apart," she told Haveram. "I don't think we can do much more without burning it."
>
>Haveram nodded and walked away toward the other side of the dig site, where he had set up his own work area.
>
>"What's wrong?" asked Captain Jenkins. He'd arrived at the dig site while Alex was talking to Haveram. "You look worried."
>
>"Nothing's wrong," Alex replied. "But I'm not sure how much good we're going to be able to do here. We might need to get some help from the base."

>**Alexandria piloted the ship closer, and turned on her spotlight, illuminating the eons old alien derelict ship.** The light was swallowed by the hull as she moved into position beside it. A small, faint blue glow lit up the interior of the vessel.
>
>“It’s been here for a long time,” said Halsey. “Centuries at least.”
>
>She had left the hatch open, and they could see inside the ancient craft. It was dark, but there were traces of light—small points of glowing blue that seemed to move slowly across the walls. They reminded Alexandria of fireflies, or the luminous bacteria in some deep sea trenches. But these lights didn’t seem to be coming from any living creature; they glowed with an eerie regularity.
>
>“There are no signs of damage,” said Halsey. “But I can’t say what might have happened to the crew.” She glanced over at Alexandria. “I don’t think we should go in.”
>
>Alexandria frowned. “We need to find out what’s going on here.”
>
>“And how do you propose we do that?” asked Halsey. “You saw the size of this thing. We wouldn’t even fit inside.”
>
>Alexandria thought about it for a moment. “How big is the bridge?”
>
>Halsey shook her head. “No idea.”
>
>“Then we’ll start with the bridge,” Alexandria Kira. “The rest will follow.”

It whipped around the woman's head with an explosive hiss, clamped down on her face, and dragged her into the blackness. She screamed once, long and shrill, before she disappeared completely.

*Intended to introduce inspiration by Ancient Rome, this draws from books written by Colleen McCullough and classics such as I, Cladius, with epic battles by legionaries against the barbarians as gladiatorial spectacles. Political intrigue abound!*

>**Rome! The greatest city in the world, and my home.** I would rather die than leave it."
>
>"I understand," said Caesar coldly. "You are a patriot as well as an opportunist; you will not be happy anywhere else. But that is your own affair." He turned to me again. "So we have decided: the three of us shall stay together for one year only. We need time to decide what our next step should be."

>"If there were more men like you two around, perhaps Rome could still stand!" Antonia spoke with feeling. She was very beautiful at this moment, her face flushed from wine or excitement, but she looked tired too. Her eyes seemed haunted by some memory, though whether good or bad she did not say.
>We had been talking about politics all evening. It was clear now why Pompey's letter had caused such dismay among his supporters.

*Trained on The Mabinogion, Gawain and the Green Knight, and various other Arthurian stories.*

> Mordred grew up to become a great warrior just like his father before him. His mother never forgot how much she owed to the woman who saved her life. She gave birth to Mordred knowing that she had given him something very special—the gift of magic. He was born able to use powers beyond normal men—powers which allowed him to control animals and spirits. When he reached adulthood he joined the ranks of the Knights of the Round Table. And there he met Elaine of Cornwall—a beautiful young lady whose eyes held him captive. Their love was true and pure. They vowed to spend their lives together.
>
> When they married, they made a vow: Never shall either of us leave the other side of the world. So great was their love for each other that they swore to go together wherever fate might send them. As a token of their promise they took an oath upon themselves. To the end of time, neither of them shall ever break the bond of marriage. If one should die first then the survivor must take the dead spouse's place beside him on the throne of Britain. The two of them spent all of their time together. Even at the risk of their own lives they protected others from harm.
>
> It was at a tournament held near the city of Caerleon in Wales that the two of them came face to face for the first time. There was a fierce battle going on. A man was lying wounded in the middle of the field. The knights of the court gathered around him trying to help.
> "I'm sorry to say," said the man to Mordred. "But I fear I am dying."
>
> "You are not going to die," said Mordred. "I'll save you."
>
> The man looked at Mordred in amazement. "You? You are only a boy! How can you possibly do such a thing?"
>
> "Because I am the king's son," replied Mordred.

>
>The game starts and I see that this time my opponent is Yoshi! He has three lives left so he can't die yet. And his first move was to throw me off balance by throwing fireballs at me from behind.
>
>Now we're both running around the map trying to catch each other up. He's going for the flag, while I'm trying to avoid his attacks. Then he throws another fireball but misses and I manage to grab it and use it to attack back. But then Yoshi comes right out of nowhere with a big jump kick and knocks me into the air!
>
>He catches me and throws me across the screen, knocking me out of bounds. Now I'm on the edge of the map and there are no more flags or items nearby. So now what? It looks like I've lost. But wait... Yoshi has only one life left! If I knock him out here, he dies too.
>
>Yoshi sees this coming and jumps over to where I am lying on the ground. I get ready to knock him away again, when suddenly he turns into a mushroom! Then he flies straight through the wall and disappears. The game ends as soon as Yoshi loses all his lives.
>
>I look up at the clock and see that I just barely beat him in time. Yoshi gets 3 points and I get 5. This makes my total score 30 points.

Trained on various texts from Internet Sacred Text Archive (including: The Myths of Mexico and Peru by Lewis Spence, The Hymn of Huitzilopochtli, The Festival of The Sun, and more), and extracts on Aztec gods from Mythopedia.

>The Sun, in his anger at the theft of his sister-wife, struck down her brother with a bolt from his golden bow. The woman was transformed into a serpent and became the goddess Quetzalcoatl.
>
>In another version of this myth she is called Xiuhtlilotli (the daughter of the sun), who went to live among the stars and bore twin sons to Huitzilopochtli: Tonatiuh ("sun") and Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli ("moon"). These were then adopted by their grandfathers, Tezcatlipoca and Omeyocan, and given new names as lords of heaven. They also had two sisters; one became the moon, while the other married Mixcohuatzin and gave birth to Mictlan, the god of death. This legend appears to have been derived from an earlier tale that told how Quetzalcoatl's father, Itzcuauhcihuatl, had been killed by his younger brothers for having stolen fire from them. A later addition described him as 'a son of heaven' rather than of the sun or Venus.
>
>To these myths are added many others concerning the creation of mankind, which may be grouped under three main heads—those relating to the origin of man, those describing his development through ages, and those dealing with the end of all things.

> "Are you sure?"

> The words were spoken in a voice that was both sweet and teasing, the kind of voice that had been used on him for as long as he could remember. He was sure. He had to be.
>
> "Yes," he said again. "I'm sure."
>
> He looked up at her. She was beautiful, so much like his mother that it was almost eerie. But she wasn't his mother. His mother had died when he was young. This woman...this creature...was nothing but a figment of his imagination. A figment of his subconscious. The last remnants of his grief over the loss of his parents.
>
> And yet, even knowing that, he couldn't stop staring at her. Couldn't look away.
>
> She smiled, then, a smile that was as bright and warm as the sun. It was the smile of a woman who knew exactly what she wanted.

> "Then let's go home, Bruce," she said. "Let's go home together."

*This module is trained with a focus on battle scenes from fiction set in the BattleTech tabletop universe and the related MechWarrior & MechCommander video games. 2mb, 1000 steps.*

*Always refer to mechs as 'Mechs, and dropships as DropShips etc... for best results.*

*Material curated and formatted in tandem with Human Error.*

*Possible future updates to this module will include more lore and technical fluff text.*

***What to expect from this module:***

- *Epic battles of giant heavily armed and armored walking tanks known as 'Mechs, as well as other vehicles like conventional tanks, spacecrafts, jets, hovercrafts, naval vessels, and also infantry.*
- *Missiles, lasers, ballistic weapons, airstrikes, and bombs.*
- *Galactic scale political intrigue, betrayal, and sabotage.*
- *Paid mercenary forces loyal only to the almighty C-Bill.*
- *Professional bloodsport arena combat between mechs before a spectator audience.*

***What not to expect from this module:***

- *Lore accuracy. Don't hope for it, seriously.*

>"Contact!" A voice shouted over comms. "Two enemy 'Mechs approaching from the south-east quadrant. One hundred meters away."
>
>A chill ran down the spine of every MechWarrior present. That was the direction from which most of the bandits had come, and the only place on the island where 'Mechs would approach without being seen.
>
>"All units, prepare for combat maneuvers. Target priority: Bandits. Repeat, target priority: Bandits."
>
>Taylitha jerked the joystick, and the Atlas lurched forward on its massive legs. She hit the throttle and the 'Mech surged ahead, leaving the other 'Mechs behind it.
>
>"50 meters, 3 o'clock!"
>
>The warning came over the comm, followed by the sound of something tearing into the ground.
>
>"30 meters, 2 o'clock!"
>
>"20, 1 o'clock!"
>
>"10, straight ahead!"
>
>"Fire!"
>
>The battle erupted at once.
>
>"Bandit down," came the call over the comm.
>
>The Atlas slowed down and pulled back slightly so it wouldn't interfere with the others in the fight.
>
>"Enemy 'Mechs engaging the rest of the lance," another voice reported over the comm.
>
>"We're going after the leader," Kasten said.
>
>"Roger," replied the second voice.
>
>"What are your orders?"
>
>"I'll take the right flank. You cover the left," Kasten said.
>
>"Affirmative. I'm on my way."
>
>"Don't kill him unless you have to," Kasten added.
>
>Taylitha centered her reticle over a grouping of UrbanMechs, then mashed the primary firing group trigger, unleashing a barrage of PPC fire. The weapons spat blue lightning from their barrels, carving a path through the cluster of machines.
>
>She moved the crosshairs to the next target and fired again, this time hitting a nearby Clan OmniMech. It staggered backward under the onslaught, then fell.

>Cú Chulainn and his foster-brother Ferdia, who had been brought up together in the same house. But Cú Chulainn was a great man of war; he went out to fight against Conchobar son of Nectan for that reason, because he would not pay him tribute when he asked it:
>
>'I have neither wife nor children,' said Conchobar, 'and I am an old man without wealth or possessions.'
>
>Then they fought one another on the field of battle near Tara. And at first there were many champions on either side with their weapons ready and eager for combat. Then the two men fell into each other's hands, and each took hold of the opposite sword hilt. Each gripped the handle firmly so as to prevent himself from being thrown away by the strength of his adversary. When this happened, both swords broke off short in the middle, but they did not break apart. They stood thus gripping each other's wrists until nightfall. That is why today we call them †Fáel Dé (‡) Fáel Dé( ) and Fáel Dóid ( ).
>
>They stayed till morning and then returned home. The host of Conchobar saw what had occurred between them, and said, 'It seems my kinsman has some special power over yours!' He therefore challenged Cú Chulainn again to single combat. This time he met him outside the city walls where the contest began in earnest. It lasted three days and nights, and Cú Chulainn killed him. So now Conchobar lay dead upon the battlefield.
>
>And then the king sent messengers throughout Ulster asking if any champion could come forward to take revenge for the death of his brother. Thereupon Óenach Maelgha came forward saying, "I will do this."

*Get you leather jackets and shades to step out into the neon-filled sprawls of the near future! Trained on classic cyberpunk work, mostly from the 80s. So expect more of a retro-Cyberpunk experience. The cyberpunk genre is a bit hard to pin down, and I selected broad selection of works. So this might need a bit of handholding at first to produce the themes you are going for. I do not have time to extensively test modules at the moment, so if you end up using this feel free to ping me about your experiences with the module!*

>Ghost walked into Club Penumbra and let the beat fill him. He wished he wasn't hunting business.

>The last thing he wanted was to be caught in a firefight, but that's what you got for going after an old man who doesn't want to die yet.

*The module can generate pretty amazing Cyberpunk output, but **IMPORTANT: you have to add [ Genre: Cyberpunk ] to the A/N.** There is definitely a huge difference between default and this module, even if you need to add the Genre, I tested it.*

>**Mike arrived at the black market bar** with a bad feeling. The place was called "The Overlook", and it had been a popular meeting spot for local hackers and pirates for years, but lately Mike had noticed that some of its clientele seemed to be showing up with bruises and worse on their faces. He'd tried asking around about it once or twice, but nobody wanted to talk in public. Some people were scared of what might happen if they got involved; others just didn't want to know.
>
>It wasn't hard to find out where the trouble was coming from. It started at the door, as usual. A pair of bouncers, big men with shaved heads and matching tattoos across their cheeks. They stood there like statues, watching the crowd come and go through an eye-slit in the middle of each helmet. No one got past them without being scanned and IDed by a small box on their belt. You could argue about whether this made you safer, or just more visible. If anyone did try anything stupid, the bouncers would take care of it. Nobody argued.
>
>Once inside, Mike found himself facing another set of guards. These ones looked like musclebound cyborgs. Their arms ended in long bionic fingers tipped with vicious spikes. They wore bulky combat armour over which their muscles bulged like thick cables straining against their sleeves.

> **Leaving Neverwinter, the dwarf Magnus Bigpuffer reflected on his journey north, to Luskan.** He had never been there before and he didn't know what to expect when he arrived. The city was notorious for its lack of respect toward dwarves.
> The last time a caravan from Waterdeep had come through town it had brought with it an angry mob that intended to kill all the dark elves living in Luskan. Fortunately, the leader of the caravan had stopped at the gates long enough to explain matters to the guards-and then paid them off handsomely. As a result, no one wanted to start trouble with the merchants or their hired fighters. But every merchant knew that if things went sour between him and the guardhouse, he would be lucky to get out alive.
>
> Still, some people were not satisfied by this arrangement. One particularly large and ugly human named Torgar Skullsplitter seemed determined to make life miserable for everyone who entered the city. His soldiers did nothing but harass travelers, especially those who looked like they might have something worth stealing. And so most traders avoided going into the city altogether.
>
> Magnus wondered how many other cities followed the example set by Luskan: towns where only humans lived? Would any other race ever dare enter such places? Perhaps after years of being treated as second class citizens, the drow felt justified in treating others less favorably than themselves. Or perhaps they simply enjoyed making enemies wherever possible.

>The ground shook with the thunder of cannon fire and explosions. A wall of steel slammed into them as their enemies poured through a breach in the line. They'd managed to hold back most of the enemy forces for now—but they were being pushed back toward the city's main gate.
>
>"We need to fall back!" Alex shouted over his tactical channel. "They're going to overrun us." He saw one of his men go down, then another, and he cursed under his breath. That was it; that was all they could do here. Their remaining squads would be cut off from the rest of the company if they didn't retreat soon.
>
>He pulled up his HUD just long enough to see where everyone else on his team was positioned. MacLachlan was still holding out against an assault by two full companies, but their left flank had been forced back almost half way across the field. Alex saw Corporal Dolan's team fighting desperately to keep the mercenaries at bay, while Captain Strand's people fought to get past them to cover the retreating soldiers. And Sergeant Klinner's team was nowhere to be seen. Had they lost contact? Or had they already fallen? Either way, there wasn't much time left before everything fell apart.
>
>Alex turned his attention back at the big tank. It looked like some kind of giant insect, squatting menacingly atop its massive legs. But instead of mandibles or pincers, this thing held a single large cannon.

>M14's head was spinning. She had been in the thick of it all day, and she felt like a fool for not seeing what everyone else saw - that this whole thing with S7 was nothing more than an elaborate set-up to get her out here where they could finish their work on her. That thought alone made M14 feel sick. The girl was so much weaker now; she wasn't even strong enough to defend herself against the likes of those two girls! And then there was BR55... M14 shuddered at the memory.
>
>She recalled how quickly BR55 had taken advantage of M14 when she'd let down her guard during one of their earlier sparring sessions. How easily she had broken through M14's defenses, hacking into her neural cloud and taking control over her body without any effort or resistance from her. It hadn't even been a fight. All the same, the experience left a bad taste in the doll's mouth.
>
>"It doesn't make sense..." M14 muttered to no-one in particular, the words spilling from her lips as though they came unbidden. "Why would BR55 do that to me? Why risk her own life just to get rid of me?"
>
>The doll's eyes fell upon the gun in her hands. the warped reflection in its polished form seemed to stare right back at the doll and through her face, mocking her.
>
>"I'm the weakest of the lot, and I know it. But still you try to take my life away from me," she said bitterly, a cold chill running down her spine as the voice echoed in her mind.
>
>The doll's grip tightened around the weapon, the metal and plastic digging into the flesh of her fingers.

*Another Tolkien module but expanded to nearly the entire published legendarium. Partially (manually) edited to remove publishing artifacts like chapter and section breaks, Chris Tolkien's notes about his father's writing process, appendices, and other elements unsuitable to generating narrative prose and verse. Excluded HOMES (too fragmentary/meta) and minor publications like Adventures of Tom Bombadil and Bilbo's Last Song*

>**High on the walls of the city** he saw a great company of men and women, tall and fair to look upon; but they were clad in black. And some bore long spears with sharp points like needles or swords, while others had bows that bent not only swiftly but far. But there was no sound save their own voices as they sang together:
>
>‘Come ye out from your houses! Come forth into the streets! The day is come for burning all evil things! For we are the servants of Elendil who dwelt here before the beginning of days. We have cleansed this place by fire, so it shall be clean again. All that has been done here since the world began must now be undone. Let those who would live in peace go up into the hills where none will find them. Let those who love war make ready. It is our hour. In darkness let us work deeds of light!’

> **The Enclave is** a religious organization dedicated to the eradication of all non-humans. It was formed by former Vault dwellers who had become disillusioned with their former masters and wanted to create an enclave where they could live in peace. The Enclave's main base of operations is located in the Mojave Wasteland, but it also has outposts in other parts of the United States and even abroad.

*Imagine dreary saxophone music, desolate streetlamps, and a lone figure walking through the drizzling rain. Noir fiction is Film noir's literary sister, and she portrays crime fiction in bleak hues of moral gray. Even the protagonists are deliciously flawed. Perhaps unsurprisingly, you will also find a lot of alcohol and an unhealthy fixation on cigarettes.*

*This module was experimentally trained on 101 books from the Hard Case Crime series, comprising a selection of vintage noir paperbacks and modern novels. Its publisher's intent is to "recreate the flavor and setting of the paperback crime novels of the 1940s and '50s."*

*The files were converted with Calibre and then cleaned under the Datasetting Guide.*

*Notes: The effect of this module is very broad. Putting your desired tags in the Author's Notes, such as [ Tags: Crime Noir, Night, 1950s. ] should improve performance.*

*Sources: (32.5mb, 10000 steps, 26.46% coverage, 2.61 loss)*

> I could have made a call to the police and told them what had happened, but I knew it would do no good. They'd just come up with some story about how they'd been looking for me because of my record, and that would be that. And if I did go back to the police station and tell them that I'd seen her dead in a room at the hotel where she worked, then I'd probably end up in jail myself. There was no way around it; I had to take care of things myself.
>
> So I called the number on the card and waited until one of the girls answered. She asked me who I wanted to talk to, and I said it was Mr. MacFinn. Then I gave her my name and told her that I needed to speak with him right away.
>
> She said he wasn't there and that she didn't know when he'd be back.

> "Tell him it's Joe," I said.

> "You're a lucky man, Johnny," the lieutenant said. "Your wife's one hell of a woman."

> Johnny nodded. "She is that." He had been afraid to ask about his mother, but he knew it was better not to mention her at all. The less said about her the better.
>
> He sat in the back seat of the police car and watched as they drove down Wilshire Boulevard toward downtown Los Angeles. He looked around him. There were several other men in the car with them, two detectives and an assistant district attorney. They seemed friendly enough. But Johnny didn't like being here. It made him feel dirty.

> The lieutenant saw where he was looking and turned his head to look out the window. "It won't be long now, Johnny. We'll get this over with and then you can go home."

>"You're a fool," he said to Snowman, in English. "A foolish man." He spat into the snow beside him. Then he kicked it away from himself with one foot. "I have been here before—you cannot see me now because I am invisible!"
>
>Snowman looked around nervously as if afraid that someone else might hear this madman's ravings. The ranger stood very still, watching the ghoul intently. She was not sure what she expected him to do next; perhaps shoot the ghoul dead where he lay or run off screaming in terror of an imaginary monster. But when nothing happened after several long moments, she relaxed slightly. It appeared that the ghoul had no intention of attacking them. Perhaps he had gone insane like so many others who were stranded out there alone, living among the ruins of their world. Maybe he just wanted some company. Or maybe he intended to kill Snowman for food. Either way, the two Rangers would be better off without him.
>
>"What are you doing?" asked Snowman, speaking slowly and carefully, trying hard to keep his voice calm. "Why did you come down here? What is your name?"
>
>"My name is Ghoul," replied the ghoul, turning toward the boy again. "And yours, sir?"
>
>"Ranger Walker," answered the girl. "This is my partner, Ranger Snowman."

>"Ah! A woman Ranger. You must make good use of her skills." His eyes glittered ferally as they focused on Snowman. "She can help you find more women to eat."

> The cave was cool and damp, the floor littered with leaves. It smelled of dead wood, but there were other odors as well: smoke from a fire, an animal's musk, old sweat, urine. The walls glistened with moisture. A few drops fell on her face as she stood in the entrance. She brushed them away impatiently. Her heart pounded and her breath came fast. Why had she come here? She didn't know. She just knew that when she saw it, she would have to go inside.
>
> She looked around at the familiar surroundings again, then stepped forward into the dark space. It was large enough for two or three people to stand side by side, though only one could comfortably walk through it. She noticed some differences; the smell of smoke wasn't so strong anymore. There was also a faint odor of fresh water nearby. She moved slowly toward the back wall, feeling her way along the rough stone. The cave seemed much larger now than before, and the air was warmer. When she reached the back wall, she stopped, still not sure what to do next.
>
> Then she heard something. A soft rustling sound. It grew louder and closer until she recognized the distinctive footfalls of a small creature padding softly across the floor behind her. She turned quickly, expecting to see another animal, perhaps a fox or a wolf.

*The goal of this is to include novels from around the original trilogy, as well as novels set shortly before and afterward chronologically (Roughly 5 years before or 5 years after). This is to include things like Rogue One, and the Thrawn Trilogy, that arguably have the same general 'vibe' as the original trilogy. This does mix canon books with legends books, but I figure if you're using NovelAI, you don't care much about canon.*

- Tarkin
- Thrawn
- Rogue One Novelization
- X-Wing 1: Rogue Squadron
- Original Trilogy Novelization
- Complete Thrawn Trilogy
- A Small collection of Original Trilogy + Rogue One romantic fanfiction to add contextual awareness for mature themes.

> "Only Imperial soldiers have access to this kind of equipment," Luke said. "That was no blaster bolt you saw coming at your head."

> Han frowned. It was true; the stunner had been one of those old-fashioned nonlethal models, its charge fully spent when it hit the wall beside the door.
>
> "So what do we do?" Leia asked.
>
> Luke shrugged. "We go in and get him out," he said. "If that's all right with you, Han."
>
> Han looked at his friend. He didn't like the idea much himself, but there wasn't anything else they could do. Not without making themselves a target for the whole roomful of stormtroopers. "Sure," he agreed. "Let's do it."
>
> The door slid open as they approached, revealing another corridor identical to the one outside. They walked down it toward the sound of voices echoing from somewhere ahead. "I don't see any guards," Han muttered.
>
> "They're probably waiting for us on the other side of that door," Luke pointed out. "Come on."
>
> Han reached for his blaster. Luke reached for his saber. Leia just held her breath.
>
> But the voice that came through the door was a familiar one. "Luke!" Chewbacca roared. "You're alive! I knew you'd make it back."
>
> "Hello, Wookiee," Luke called back. "What's he saying?"
>
> "He says to tell you he loves you," Leia translated.
>
> "Oh, yeah?" Han growled. "Well, I love him, too."
>
> Chewbacca laughed. "I know you do," he said. "I can hear it in your voice."
>
> "Okay, okay," Han grumbled. "All right, let's move."
>
> They crossed the threshold into the cell block and headed straight for the door at the far end. A group of stormtroopers were standing guard over it, their weapons drawn. But as soon as they spotted Luke and his companions, they lowered them. "Welcome back, Master Skywalker," one of them greeted him. "We've been expecting you."

> **"This is where the fun begins."** For a moment Anakin thought Obi-Wan had heard him. Or maybe not? The sky was so low and black with his exhaust plumes that he could hardly hear over the ViiR thrumming of antigrav.

> He wasn't here to observe great strategy and play out vast sagas, either among allies or against enemies in this garish netherworld between sanity and insanity. But even though his patience was running thin, he owed Obi-Wan whatever shred of rationality, courtesy or understanding that Obi-Wan happened to believe, under the circumstances, might not be insulting right then.

> The road had been smooth for most of the day, but now it began to climb steeply into the mountains. The wind picked up speed and strength; clouds scudded across the sky like dark birds flying south. It was a storm coming. Charley knew that much. He could feel it in his bones.

>The footsteps came closer, and now they were accompanied by another sound—a strange scraping sound like claws dragging across concrete or metal. It wasn't an animal, though; it sounded too human for that. And it didn't seem to be coming from one person either...it seemed to come from several people walking together.

>She took careful aim down the length of the alleyway, but couldn't see anything past the first few feet. The moonlight was just enough to show her what looked like a group of shadowy figures approaching through the dark streets.

[by Manwhore](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/359952842/#360055304)

*Bear witness, gentlemen, to my newest coomtech creation!*

*I've been hitting the lab ever since v4 dropped to get my template scenario polished up and hitting even higher smut-producing heights. And now, it's ready for you to mutilate as you see fit.*

*Inside you'll find further refinements of my low-randomness TFS settings package, a fresh bundle of redone phrase biases at new weights paired with a banned token or two, and most importantly, the fifth version of my personal module, retrained with new data and higher percentage of steps for Sigurd v4.*

*I've taken this package for a spin on multiple different prompts from my private reserve, and so far the thing's been an incredible workhorse. On a sunny day this bad boy takes me from start to finish on a scenario for a whopping three to four re-rolls total, with everything from vanilla sex to moth-girl maternal femdom involving four hands and aphrodisiac powder. Let me know what I fucked up, how it runs, etc.*

*Enjoy.*

*Expect a tasteful dash of Victorian spice. Where version one of Purely Purple Prose was made to give people a feel for what the Purple Prose Supplementary Dataset could add to one's own modules, and version two was crafted specifically to hone in on the "Classical" nature inherent with fiction under Creative Commons and so trained alongside a few of the completed works... version three was basically just bestowed upon us by the devs and their outstanding work on Sigurd V4. All I did was retrain it for the new finetune, and things are looking more coherent than ever. Nicely moody, while not overpowering you with olden day references.*

*3.26MBs trained for %115 data coverage.*

> **The night** was dark, and the stars shone with a pale lustre. The wind went moaning by, like a low distant sea; and there were no clouds in the sky. From time to time, one of those sudden gusts of cold air came rushing down from the north-east, and set all the woods rustling, and brought a white sheet of spray across the lake, which rose up before it as if startled out of its sleep. But this night-breeze had passed away again, when the figure that stood on the bridge, shivered and shook convulsively for some seconds, and then fell forward into the water.
>
>It was a man’s shape; but not a living man: even in the faint starlight, you might have told that at once. There was something hanging about it, which made it look more like a corpse than anything else. It lay face downwards in the shadow of the bridge, and moved not when the boat touched it. A few strokes took us alongside. We drew our knives, and leaped on shore. I stooped over the body, and felt it heartily.

##### [Surrealistic Look Through The Glass](https://files.catbox.moe/pxmwlb.module)

*This is a theme module for those that enjoy surrealistic, whimsical, and sometimes dark stories along the vein of Lewis Carrol's Alice's Adventure in Wonderland, or Neil Gaiman's Neverwhere.*

>**Morgan's brows furrowed, and he stared** at me for a long moment. "How do you know that?" he asked finally.
>
>"Because it was in the book," I said, pointing to my lap where The Wind in the Willows lay open on my knee. "I read it when I was little."
>
>"That book? It's not real."
>
>"Of course it is," I insisted. "It's all about a river and an otter who lives in it."
>
>"Otters don't live in rivers."
>
>"They do in this one."
>
>Morgan snorted. "I've never heard of such a thing. You're making up stories." He shook his head, frowning. "No one has ever seen an otter or a river in Faerie."
>
>"Yes they have," I said stubbornly. "The otter lived with the king's daughter in her garden. And there was a river—"
>
>"A stream," Morgan interrupted. "You can't call a trickle of water a river."
>
>I gave him a haughty look. "We can if we want to."
>
>He rolled his eyes. "Fine. A stream then."
>
>"There were fish in it," I continued. "And frogs. And ducks. And sometimes—sometimes it rained."
>
>Morgan looked like he wanted to argue, but instead he just sighed and ran a hand through his hair.

>**Once upon a time** there was a little girl who lived at the bottom of a well. She had never been out, and she didn't know how to get out. So every day, when her mother came down to fetch water from the pump in the yard above, she would climb up the rope ladder and sit on the edge of the bucket while her mother filled it. Then they would both go back up again. It was lonely living at the bottom of a well, but you have to remember that this was a long time ago, before people used buckets for everything.
>
>The little girl had a white dress with red spots all over it; and because she was so small, she could easily hide inside the bucket when her mother wasn't looking. The handle of the bucket was wooden, carved in the shape of an elephant's head.
>
>One day, as her mother went up to the pump, the little girl slipped out of the bucket and ran away. There were no grown-ups around, so she climbed onto the top of the well and sat there until her mother came home.
>
>"What are you doing up there?" asked her mother. "Come down at once!"
>
>But the little girl didn't want to come down, because it was such a nice place to be. So she said: "I'm too old to play games. I'll stay here till tomorrow."
>
>And she stayed there all night, even though it began to rain very hard. When her mother came into the kitchen next morning, she found the little girl lying under the table, fast asleep.

*If you love exploring the relationships and interactions between androids, robots, artificial intelligences, and humans, this is the module for you! It covers Issac Asimov, Martha Wells' Murderbot, Charles Stross' Saturn's Children and others.*

>**\*\*\***
>
>**The android** had to have a name. I called it Ganymede, after the moon of Jupiter. It was the only one who could handle the heavy lifting and get us into orbit quickly enough. The other three were too small for that job.
>
>I didn't know what else to call them, so I gave each one an arbitrary designation. I chose the names based on their personalities or something they said in passing. In my opinion, they weren't very good at anything except being robots, but we couldn't afford to be choosy about our crew members. If we got stuck with someone stupid, we'd probably die trying to fix him.
>
>As far as personality went, I tried not to judge people by looks alone; however, if you looked closely at all four of these guys, there was no mistaking any of them. They might look like humans, but they were machines inside---androids programmed to act human. Sooner or later, though, I would need to make some decisions. Maybe this trip would help me decide which ones should go home when we returned from space.

*Module focused on Angels and Demons trained on a variety of sources from authors like Michele Hauf, Bella Swann, Michael Dalton, Kathryn Moon and Elliot Kay -- high quality erotica.*

*Strong themes of corruption, capture, and BDSM.*

*Also has A Lady of Rooksgrave Manor twice to infuse a little bit of monstrous cross-genre, as it's such a fantastic work.*

>**\*\*\***
>
>**The Succubus smiled at me.** "You have a strong spirit, my dear." She leaned forward to kiss the top of my head and whisper in my ear. "I like that about you." Her lips brushed against mine as she spoke. I felt her warm breath on my neck. My skin tingled from it. It was an odd sensation -- almost pleasant. The demon's tongue flicked out and lapped at the side of my throat. A shiver ran down my spine.
>
>"Mmm," I moaned softly into her mouth. "What are you doing?"
>
>She laughed with glee, letting go of me so she could straighten up. "Enjoying myself for once!" She giggled again before turning back toward the mirror. Her hands moved over herself slowly, teasingly. "It is nice being able to touch your body this way. You are quite beautiful, Rachel. Your breasts look delicious."
>
>My face flushed hot. I couldn't help but notice how hard my nipples were beneath my shirt. They ached slightly even though they weren't erect yet. There was no denying what had happened when we'd kissed earlier, either. We both knew exactly where our bodies wanted each other to be touching right now.
>
>"Are there any more demons here besides us?" asked Alex. His voice sounded strained. He didn't seem comfortable talking around his sister. Maybe he wasn't sure if she would agree to speak with him or not? Or maybe he just didn't want to say anything else.
>
>"Not here, sweetie," said the succubus. "We're alone. But don't worry; I'm going to take care of you soon enough."
>
>Alex gulped loudly.
>
>I looked between them, trying to figure something out. What did they mean by 'take care' of him? Wasn't that kind of vague? Did she mean sexually? If so...well, I guess I should expect nothing less than the best from a succubus!
>
>"Don't worry, Alex," she continued, pulling off her blouse. "This won't hurt much at all."
>
>Her bra came next. Then she unbuttoned her skirt and let it drop to the floor. She stepped out of it completely, leaving only her white panties covering her dark pubic hair. Her legs were smooth and pale, except for some light tan lines running along their length. Her feet were small and dainty.
>
>All eyes were fixed upon her perfect body. Even the ones belonging to two who were supposed to be in love with each other.
>
>The Succubus grinned at me wickedly. "Do you like my new outfit?"
>
>"Um ... yeah, um ..." I stammered awkwardly.
>
>"Well then, why don't you get undressed too?"

>**\*\*\***
>
>**The angel** was waiting for her when she arrived. "Thank you, Lorelei," he said with a smile as the door shut behind them. He held out his hand and helped her down from the carriage. She took it gratefully. The air smelled like fresh rain on the wind that blew in through an open window. It had been months since she'd last visited this place. Her wings were still sore from their flight here, but they felt better than ever before.
>
>"How are you?" he asked. His voice was soft and warm.
>
>She smiled at him. "I'm well."
>
>He nodded once. "Good. I have something to show you."
>
>They walked past several rooms filled with bookshelves full of bound volumes, some old and worn, others new and crisp. There were no windows in these halls. Instead there were arched openings where light streamed in from above. They passed by paintings of angels and men and women holding hands or embracing each other, all smiling happily. Some looked up toward the ceiling, while others gazed down upon the floor below. In one painting, two lovers stood side-by-side, sharing a kiss. A third man watched over them both, his expression unreadable. Another showed three children sitting together around a table playing cards. Their smiles seemed genuine, though perhaps not entirely free of worry. Two more depicted scenes of violence: a woman being strangled by a demon's claws; another woman pinned beneath the body of a fallen soldier. Both images made Lorelei shiver.
>
>In contrast, a few pictures showed couples kissing tenderly under stars shining brightly overhead. One featured a young boy standing next to his mother. The way they looked into each other's eyes spoke volumes about how much love they shared.
>
>Lorelei stopped walking and turned back to look at the angel who led her. "What is this place? Is it Heaven?"
>
>His brow furrowed slightly. "No. This is my home. And it's yours too, if you choose to stay."
>
>"But why would I want to do such a thing? You're immortal, aren't you? Why would anyone bother to keep you alive?"
>
>"It's what we do," he answered simply. "We are angels. We serve God, just as any human does. But unlike humans, our purpose isn't limited to this world alone. Our souls live forever, so long as we continue to walk alongside Him. As for why someone might care enough to keep us here...that's between me and God." He paused for a moment, then added, "You don't need to know anything else unless you wish to learn."
>
>A chill ran down her spine at his words. He didn't seem particularly concerned with answering her questions, and she found herself wanting to press further. Was that because he wanted to keep things that way, or did he truly believe she wouldn't be interested? She wasn't sure which answer pleased her most. Either way, she decided to let him lead the conversation. After all, she could always ask later. If he refused to tell her, that was fine. She'd find out soon enough anyway.
>
>As they continued on, the doors opened onto a large room filled with dozens of beds. Each bed was occupied by an angel, either sleeping peacefully or staring blankly off into space. All wore white robes, and many had wings folded neatly against their backs. Most of them appeared healthy, but some looked ill, pale and thin. Many of the sickest ones lay curled up in fetal positions. Others were hooked up to IVs or machines. None of them moved or reacted when the pair entered the room. Lorelei wondered whether they were even aware of the people around them.
>
>The angel walked over to one of the closest beds and knelt down. It was empty. "This one was lost when the angels fell from heaven," he said. "He was one of the first, and the last. His name was Adam."
>
>Adam. That was the same man whose soul Lorelei had stolen. Her chest tightened. She couldn't imagine the pain of losing your life and having it taken away. It was unimaginable.

*A module that helps introduce catgirls into a story! All stories use the term "catgirl", so this term will likely produce the best results. Inspired to counteract Sigurd’s bias to always include fur. (commissioned)*

> [ Describe the Catgirls ]
>
>The girls looked like human females with cat ears or tails attached. Their eyes were blue instead of brown but their pupils were circular rather than oval shaped. It didn't look as if they had fur on their bodies because you could see their skin under their clothes.

>
>The man smiled at me, a slow smile that made his eyes twinkle with amusement. He was quite handsome in an old-fashioned way, with dark hair curling over his collar and strong features. His clothes were of good quality but rather worn—the sort of thing you'd wear to a party on Earth, if it had been held two hundred years ago. I imagined him as he might have looked when young.
>
>He reached out for my hand and took it between both of his own. His touch sent shivers through my body. "That's all right, Miss Chumley. You can't be expected to know what your type is."

>Tall ships floated on the horizon of the star-filled night sky. Stars shone brightly in their constellations. A few dozen ships were visible from Kira's vantage point as she flew through space. All of them were different sizes, shapes, and colors. Some were streamlined, others resembled an octopus or squid with tentacles that ended in what looked like engines. Others were more angular, resembling large, elongated triangles. Still others had sharp corners or rounded curves to them, making it hard to tell what they were at first glance. Some ships appeared to be made out of metal while others seemed to be organic in nature. There was one ship, however, which was made out of a strange material that glowed blue when it caught the light of the sun. Another ship had four arms extending from its center, and it was unclear whether these were arms or legs. One of the ships was shaped like a diamond, and another resembled a giant eyeball with a long, thin stalk coming off of it. And then there was one ship that was almost completely covered by two sets of wings. Its shape reminded her of a dragonfly or a butterfly, but it also looked somewhat mechanical in nature. The strangest thing about all of them, though, was how they moved. Some of them hovered in place, while others drifted slowly through space. Many of them maneuvered through the starscape using some kind of propulsion system, while others simply flew in straight lines across the night sky. One ship even took flight and soared into the heavens. This last ship looked like a dragonfly or a butterfly. It is possible that this ship was capable of flight, but its wings were folded against its body. Instead, it used a set of propellers attached to its tail to propel itself forward. As it traveled through space, it opened its wings and flew freely.

>**[ Scene: I'm exploring new planets. ]**

>I'm standing on a rocky, wind-swept world that looks like it's been blasted by an explosion from the inside out. The sky is so dark that there's no stars to be seen and the only light comes from the dim glow of my flashlight. A strange, whirring sound fills the air around me. It sounds like some kind of giant machine. The planet has been stripped bare by some kind of force or natural process, leaving behind nothing but jagged rocks and patches of blackened sand. There are no trees, plants, or even insects.
>
>A moment later, I hear something else. It's faint at first, but soon grows louder as it approaches. I turn toward the noise and see what looks like a huge, white worm crawling across the ground. As it gets closer, I realize it's not a worm. It's much larger than anything I've ever seen before. It stops just a few feet away from me. Its body is covered in thousands of tiny eyes. Each eye stares straight into mine. They're all different sizes and colors, but they all look the same—they all have a hunger in them. The creature moves forward slowly, dragging its long tail along the ground.

*Would you like it if Life was more like a Game? interdimensional Inventory, Minimap to your use, Skills, Stats, Quests, HUD, HP, and more? Then this is the module for you.
The module is quit flexible, which makes it easy for you to adjust your Lit-rpg Rules however you wish to do. It has a preference for our modern times.*

>**My Wife screamed at me, I didn't know why but I knew what to do. I looked into her face, and used the Insight skill to analyze her motives and emotions.**
>
>The most important thing was that she'd been feeling guilty about something for a long time — it must have had some kind of impact on her psyche. She felt responsible for my brother's death. So I decided to use this guilt against her:
>
>"You're going to tell your father everything," I said calmly. "He'll understand."
>
>She fell silent. I could see how scared she was by the way she fidgeted with her hands and avoided looking at me. It wasn't easy to break someone down like that, especially not when you were just trying to help them. But there are ways of doing it...
>
>I took another step forward. This time, I touched her shoulder gently. The woman flinched slightly as if I'd shocked her, then slowly turned around.
>
>Her eyes filled with tears. Her lips trembled. And finally, she began to sob quietly.
>
>"Don't cry," I told her. "It's all right now. Everything will be fine..."

*Trained on fantasy LitRPG books. This module was made for testing both LitRPG elements (standardized to use ─ ) and <> bracketing for thinking/telepathy. Seems to work ok, so I might as well publish this. Kudos to Mr.Accountant for contributing the steps. If someone tries this and runs into issues, let me know.*

*(As v3 lacks base LitRPG data, this'll often default to pulling skills from the D&D data. It also overuses semicolon, but that's more of an issue with the old v3 data than with the module.)*

*Training: 3120 steps, 10.1MB. Trained at around 31%, last loss 2.6179. Various authors, but I won't go into details about exactly which books were included.*

> I blinked, looking down at my hands. I had to admit that the glowing blue light was a little unnerving, but I’d grown used to it over time. The new skills were still taking some getting used to though. In fact, they were so much more than just skills. They were part of me now. My own special magic.
>
> And the best part?
>
> ─ You are now able to summon and control magical creatures!
>
> That was one hell of an upgrade.
>
> The other new abilities were:
>
> ─ Improved perception (range increased by 50%)
>
> ─ Increased dexterity by 25%
>
> ─ Increased strength by 10%
>
> ─ Your mana pool has been doubled!
>
> Those were all great improvements, but what really caught my attention was this last ability.
>
> ─ You can now cast spells without using any components or incantations!
>
> This was amazing. It meant I could use my magic without having to worry about spending money on supplies like I always did before. And the most important thing? No chanting required! This would allow me to do things like cast fireballs with no problems. All I needed was enough mana to create the spell and then simply focus my mind on casting it. Simple as that.

>"It's a lie," Mary said. "I don't know what happened to him." She looked away from the woman, her eyes searching for something on the other side of the room. The walls were decorated with paintings and photographs, some in frames, others hung askew. A few had been torn or cut out of their frames; one photo was missing its glass entirely. There seemed to be no pattern to how they'd been arranged. It made it difficult to tell where she should look next.

>The woman smiled at them again, but this time there wasn't any warmth behind those lips. Her teeth were yellowed white. "You're lying," she repeated. "Or you aren't who he thinks you are. Either way, I'm going to find out."
>
>Mary felt dizzy. Everything was moving around her so quickly that she couldn't keep up. The only thing keeping her upright was Mr. Quinlan's hand gripping hers tightly. He didn't seem able to pull himself together enough to speak, either.
>
>They were surrounded by darkness now. No more light filtered through the windows. They could hear nothing except the blood pounding inside of Mary's ears. Then she saw movement near the door leading into another part of the building. Someone stepped back after letting someone else pass, then turned toward the group sitting across from the desk. And when the shadow moved closer, Mary recognized the face staring down at them: Jack's mother.

>The girl was on her back, looking up at the sky. Her face had a blank expression as if she were seeing something far away. The amount of blood flowing from her mouth and nose made it look like she'd been stabbed in the throat with an ice pick. It seemed that she hadn't died yet but...

>"What are you going to do now?"

>"...I'm sorry."
>
>That's right, I said "sorry," didn't I? What am I doing apologizing all of a sudden?! She tried to kill me! I had no choice but to defend myself!

>Her lips moved slightly; maybe she was trying to say something. I couldn't hear anything though because my ears still hurt so much. Then what about Kotoe-chan...? Wasn't she supposed to be here too? Where is she anyway? Maybe she went down fighting somewhere else or got kidnapped by someone else for some reason...? No wait, don't think about it anymore—it'll just make your head hurt more than ever...

*A utility module trained on various detailed fight scenes across many stories from The Iliad to The Princess Bride, from Logen Ninefingers in The First Law to Eowyn in The Return of the King and more. Focused mainly on melee and hand-to-hand combat in pre-modern era settings. All names have been replaced with pronouns and titles like "boy/man/woman" or "fighter/warrior/opponent" to discourage source material leaking.*

*I have found this module also works well for detailed non-sexualized physical descriptions for characters in adventuring gear or armor.*

>He could have hit her, but the best he could manage was a glancing blow to one of the other women's hands. She howled and caught at him with those long nails. He jumped back just in time to avoid them. A dark figure loomed up out of nowhere as he tried to dodge past it. The attacker came straight for his throat—but he twisted aside easily enough and seized its arm. It didn't seem to realize what had happened; if anything, it seemed surprised that there'd been an attack from behind. When it turned around again, though, it saw who it had grabbed and yanked hard on the sleeve of his shirt.
>
>"You!" he said angrily. "I thought you were dead."

>She smiled thinly and drew herself up proudly before him. "So did I," she replied sweetly.

*A module that is trained on a collection of modern detective fiction. Expect a focus on police work, sadistic serial killers, forensic evidence, and interrogation techniques.*

- *"Detective" by Arthur Hailey*
- *"A Book of Bones" by John Connolly*
- *"The Black Echo" by Michael Connelly*
- *"The Good Detective" by John McMahon*
- *"The Whisper Man" by Alex North.*

> He knew he was in trouble. The detective's face had been calm, but there had been a look of triumph on his partner's face that made him think they'd found the right place to start looking for their missing boy. He hadn't wanted them here, and he didn't want to be found by them. It would mean questions about where he'd gone, who he'd seen, and what he might have told them.
>
> "I'm not going back," he said, trying to sound strong. "It's all over."
>
> The man was silent, just staring at him. He felt a hand touch his shoulder and looked up into the eyes of a woman standing behind him. She wore a dark blue dress with an open white blouse underneath. Her hair was long and blonde and hung down her back in loose curls. He wondered how old she was, but couldn't tell.
>
> She smiled at him, then stepped forward so that she stood directly in front of him. He could smell her perfume, and it made him feel dizzy. His heart began to beat faster.
>
> "We're not police officers," she said. "But we know people who are."
>
> Her voice sounded soft, like velvet. It reminded him of the first time he'd met her.

*The purpose of this module is to give NAI a better idea of sergals, both in canon and non-canon stories. Most of the texts used are SFW, but there're some erotic scenes too. Official Vilous Wiki (the data is cleaned by hand) + several well-written fan-fiction texts taken from FurAffinity.*

> **Just like any other sergal, I'm** not exactly proud of my past. In fact, it's something that every member of our clan has in common. However, when you hear the story behind why we're called the Silver Fang Clan, you can't help but find a bit of pride for us. It was the name given to us by one of our original members and founder after he fought off an entire horde of enemies with nothing more than his two swords — the only weapons he had on him at the time. And because of this, we became known as the Silver Fangs ever since then. We are no longer considered a small mercenary band and have risen up from strength to strength over these many years. Though there is always some who claim otherwise, that particular nickname will be carried forward forevermore! Not all clans and soldiers alike come into existence through war or fighting against another group. Some clans formed by merchants or traders who needed protection; others developed out of friendships between members of different villages. While most do join together because they share similar goals, motivations vary greatly amongst those seeking what seems to be the same thing: profit.
>
> Sergals tend to see their work within each individual village differently compared to how outsiders might perceive them. They may view themselves as protecting, defending, assisting, supporting... whatever words suit your fancy. What matters isn't the meaning, however, but rather its results. As long as the end result is favourable to everyone involved, even if there's been bloodshed along the way, it doesn't matter how they got there so long as everything eventually leads towards peace and prosperity for both parties.

*Enjoy your time with a unbelievable romantic and sensitive experience. From butterflies to steamy scene, you will get what you desire. Used over 50 novels with a strong romance/erotic theme, with some scenes from each, and trained on 6 full novels.*

*It doesn't force nsfw scenes from the nothing, but it's really good at them. It could also be used as a Slice of Life module*

>He sat right in front of me, on the same table as me and my parents. I wanted him, desired him, but I had to wait until we have eaten. My parents were watching us with curiosity. It was only then that I felt like a real woman who has sex. He kept looking at me with lustful eyes while he ate his food. He started eating slowly, taking small bites from each piece of meat. When he reached the vegetables, he paused for a moment and looked up at me. I blushed and averted my gaze. But when I saw him take another bite, I became excited again. His tongue moved along the edge of his teeth before it slipped into his mouth. His hands caressed the sides of his face and neck. I could feel my own nipples harden under my top. They pressed against the thin material of my dress. The more he touched himself, the harder they got.
>
>I glanced around the restaurant and noticed all the other couples sitting together. Some people were holding hands, some kissed passionately. All of them seemed happy and satisfied. That's what I needed. I needed someone who would make me feel like that. And now I knew who it was. I smiled at him and leaned forward so that our faces were close enough to kiss. He looked back at me with surprise, but then quickly returned his attention to his meal. As soon as I realized that he didn't want to be caught doing something inappropriate in public, I stopped smiling. I straightened myself up and turned away from him. I picked up my fork and began eating. After a few minutes, I took a deep breath and relaxed my shoulders. My heart was beating faster than normal. I couldn't believe how much I'd been waiting for this man. Now that he was here, everything else seemed less important. This was the most exciting thing that ever happened to me.
>
>"Do you know why you're still single?" he asked after a long pause. "You're beautiful."
>
>I nodded shyly. I wasn't sure if I should say anything or not.
>
>"But there are many men who want you," he continued. "They just don't see your true beauty yet. You need to find one who will appreciate you completely."
>
>I closed my eyes and let out a sigh. He really did understand me. How lucky am I?
>
>"So tell me, Elena," he said softly. "What do you think about when you masturbate?"
>
>My eyes flew open wide. What does he mean by that? He knows what I'm thinking! Why is he asking me these questions? I tried to answer calmly, but I failed miserably. I stammered and blushed. He laughed at my discomfort.
>
>"Don't worry," he reassured me. "I won't judge you. It's perfectly natural to have fantasies. Especially since we've already established that you enjoy it."
>
>He winked at me. I blushed even deeper. I had no idea what to say next. Finally, I managed to ask him a question.
>
>"Can I please touch myself now?"
>
>His eyes sparkled with amusement. "Of course."
>
>He stood up and walked towards the door. Then he turned around and held his hand out to me. "Come on."

*A module trained on material from Twilight 2k 4th Edition (kickstarter pre-release copy), a post-apocalyptic military tabletop RPG from Free League Publishing. Trained on the 52 random encounter from the referee's guide. Details on input conventions can be found [here.](https://github.com/TravelingRobot/NAI_modules/blob/main/README.md#twilight-2k-encounter-generator)*

*It can generate some interesting ideas, but will need some rerolling and editing to generate something useful. Tends to break down after generating the first encounter, so it is recommended to start over anew for each encounter.*

They offer to let the PCs stay in return for some food or help with hunting down marauding wolves that threaten their livestock. If any PC is wounded during this encounter, it will be healed by an American doctor if he can get him there quickly enough. In addition, the Americans may provide them with information on local military units – such as which ones were stationed here before being withdrawn from the region, what kind of equipment was used and so forth.

>**"Keep you voice down" I whispered.**
>
>I could hear the faint sounds of distant fighting from outside, but they were too far away for me to be able to make out what was going on. We had no idea where we were in relation to any of our friends and family, so there was a lot more than just a little risk involved in trying to go back out into that chaos. The fact that the dead were already starting to move toward us made it even less appealing. We needed to find someplace safe before things got worse.
>
>We walked along the road until we came across an abandoned house. It looked like someone had tried to repair the place up a bit, but not enough to make it livable. There was one window with bars over it, but nothing else seemed useful. Lee grabbed my hand and pulled me inside. He went straight to the fireplace and started pulling wood out of the wall. After he'd gotten several armloads, he began piling them on top of each other near the front door. He continued this process until he had a pile about three feet high. He then took a lighter out of his pocket and set fire to the wood. As soon as the flames reached the first piece of kindling, Lee shut off the gas valve and left the room.
>
>I watched him walk around the corner of the building and disappear from view. A moment later, the sound of gunfire echoed through the area, followed by screams and moans. I didn't know if anyone was still alive, or how many people might have been taken by surprise when the zombies broke through their defenses. My heart sank at the thought of being trapped in here without any way out.

>Lee returned shortly after the shooting stopped.

*I made a module trained on stories I generated, it focuses on monster fucking, but works well for robots and other shit too.*

- *It's kind of shit if the thing you're dicking is a human as it tends to call things "creature" or "monster", and can give them fur/scales randomly.*
- *All material was first person, so it is extremely hard to break away from that, even forcing third person makes the story introduce you as a bystander.*
- *Heavily focused on inner monologue stuff, and sense of touch/scale/hearing.*
- *For some reason I feel it's both making the dialogue more coherent, and introducing random ass grammatical errors into the dialogue. Wasn't even much dialogue in the training set, so my writing must have tapped into something.*
- *Makes the AI really degenerate too, a small breeze blowing on you (the protagonist) makes your dick spring to life, but takes a while to coom.*

*Yup. Wasn't happy with Sigurd's buttstuff prose. Thanks to jorfl for the Literotica scrape. Note that due to how Literotica categories typically work if you're after MM you're probably better off with the Gay Romance module. This will lean heavily MF.

>"So, you're telling me that this is the best thing for both of us?" she asked in disbelief. "You want to fuck my ass so bad? You can't wait until we get back home." She paused and then said quietly, as if it were a question. "Is that why you sent those pictures? To make sure I'd agree to do this?"
>
>She had me there! The images of her beautiful butt filled with cum from last night flashed through my mind. I felt like such an asshole now. I knew exactly how much she wanted to be fucked by another man's cock. And here I am thinking about fucking her ass when all along she has been wanting mine. But, damn did she have a great body! Her tits looked amazing and her pussy... well, I've never seen one look better than hers. It was shaved smooth and already dripping wet. I could see the outline of her clit under the hood. That alone made me hard just looking at her. Damn, she must really love sex!

*This draws from higher quality erotica that covers aliens, robots, androids from various gender and narrative perspectives. Themes involve strange aliens with multiple genitals, sexy androids, abduction, and non-consent! Lust is blind!*

*This was an experiment in seeing if we could use higher quality sourced erotica around a theme; these were all sourced from bought ebooks, in the theory that you get what you pay for.*

>**\*\*\***

>**The alien gazed at me with desire in its eyes.** I couldn't help but feel a stirring inside of my loins as it continued to stare into my soul, and the longer we looked at each other, the more I wanted this creature. It was an animalistic thing that drew on primal instincts; I could see how it had been able to take over so many humans and assimilate them into their society. And now it wanted me? The thought made my heart race with excitement. If only it were possible for us to have sex...
>
>"You are very beautiful," I said after a moment's pause. "I would like to touch you." My voice sounded strange coming from my mouth, and there was something different about my face, too. I wasn't sure what exactly changed when I spoke, but it seemed to make my speech slightly slurred. But then again, maybe that was just because I'd been drinking wine all night. Either way, I didn't care if I stumbled or stuttered. All I cared about right now was getting close enough to kiss this sexy alien girl.
>
>It nodded its head once before stepping closer towards me. Its body swayed hypnotically as it moved, making it difficult to focus on anything else besides those sensual curves. When our lips met, I almost came immediately. Our tongues danced together for several moments, exploring one another's mouths. Then the alien wrapped her arms around my neck and pulled herself tightly against me. Her breasts pressed firmly against mine through the thin fabric.

> **The succubus was beautiful** but she had not been built to be a pleasure toy.
>
> "You are in my way," the demon said coldly. "I am busy." She looked at me and her eyes glittered with hunger. I could smell it on her breath; that scent of decay mixed with desire. Her hand went down between us. It moved slowly across my chest as if testing for resistance or weakness before reaching into my pants. When its fingers brushed against my cock, they were cool and slick from sweat. The creature's touch sent shivers through my body, even though we stood naked together in front of an audience. My erection throbbed painfully under her palm. A drop of pre-cum oozed out onto her fingertips. That small movement alone made me want more. More than anything else I'd ever felt. But this wasn't real life. This was just another fantasy come true. Still, there was no denying how much I wanted what lay beneath those thin black gloves. With slow deliberation, she slid them up over both hands until only two fingers remained inside my manhood. Then one finger slipped into me easily while her other held tight to my shaft. She began pumping gently back and forth, stroking herself along my length like some kind of obscene machine. Slowly, inexorably, her grip tightened around my dick.
>
> It hurt so good.
>
> As the pain faded away, something new took its place. Something wonderful, thrilling, delicious. Desire coursed through every part of me as she pumped faster and harder. Moaning softly, I wrapped my arms around her waist and pulled myself closer. Fingers dug into my ass cheeks hard enough to leave bruises. Hot breath tickled the side of my neck. Somewhere above our heads, someone moaned in delight.
>
> Then suddenly, without warning, the demon stopped moving. One hand still gripping my cock tightly, she withdrew her fingers completely. There came a wet sound when she let go of my shaft. For several seconds nothing happened. Just silence. No music played in my ears, nor did any words echo in my mind. Only emptiness filled my thoughts. And then, almost too quickly to register, the world returned to normal. Sound poured into my senses again: soft breathing, heavy footsteps, moaning laughter echoing throughout the room.
>
> She smiled wickedly at me and licked her lips. "That is quite impressive," she purred. "But you will never know satisfaction unless your partner gives consent."
>
> "No!" I gasped. "Don't stop! Please don't stop."
>
> Her smile widened. "Oh yes, Master Kade. You can have all the sex you wish tonight. Anything you want. All of it. Forever."

*Stuff included in training material to watch out for: non-con, con, sexual torture, your plain old normal torture, incest, bestiality, necro, watersports, maybe scat though I'm not sure.*

*Stuff NOT included in training material: furries. Sorry. Not my fault. The subreddit only writes about humans and normal animals for some reason.*

*Each story has been tagged. Tags are in format: [ Tags: tag1, tag2, tag3 ]. Note that the word "Tag" is capitalized but the tags themselves aren't. Tags included both fetishes/CWs and types of sex (f/f, m/f, etc.). The module doesn't really adhere to them, but they help guide it.*

*Each story had \*\*\* between them, so typing three asterisks won't start a new chapter but rather a new story.*

*I'm not sure about the best settings for the module, but it seems to be working adequately on the default ones with a lot of hand-holding.*

*The latest in my series of horror modules. Should be relatively high-quality prose, but tends toward horror as much as erotica (however, I didn't feel like I should post it on the main Discord since it is significantly weighted towards the lewd). Should work reasonably for anything from Eyes Wide Shut or Carmilla to Hellraiser or Agony levels of grotesque delight and dark ecstasy. Some variety of creature/monster stuff in the source material, alongside the more "mundane".*

*6MB, 50%; 16 well-rated and/or top-selling horror and erotic horror anthologies. Since there are dozens of authors, I won't list them all.*

*A general furry module not focusing on particular species or topics. The module is trained on a vast amount of short and medium-sized texts. Most of them are NSFW, both M/F and M/M, without any extreme fetishes, apart from several BDSM stories. A fair amount of dragon/gryphon material is included, too. As you can see from the examples, this module makes NAI horny from the very start. 96 hand-picked and cleaned furry novels and short stories taken from FurAffinity and several other sources.*

> **My tail twitched with excitement**, my cock was so hard I thought it might break. And then the tigress rolled to her back and spread those long legs of hers apart...and she raised one paw high into the air while the other reached for me, a beckoning motion that called me closer still as if telling me to come on over.
>
> I crawled between those soft thighs like some kind of moth drawn in by her alluring perfume. She grabbed hold of my wrists and pulled them up above my head, trapping me there while she pushed me down until my muzzle pressed firmly against her wet cuntlips.
>
> "Mmm..." The words escaped from her mouth as a moan. "So nice." Her fingers came together in an arch behind my shoulders, squeezing lightly at first before releasing again, forcing me even further towards her slick folds.

*This is futa on male-protagonist smut-only from CoC2 and TiTS, so it's second person (does work in first person but you might have to force it a bit). Protagonist is a trap but I don't think it matters, since it doesn't really come up a lot. It's made from basically all the major futa characters (so it's mostly futadom) from those two games. Probably has a bit of a bias towards blowjobs with how much of these the games feature.*

*About 500kb of text trained with 100% steps. Apparently for fetish stuff from smaller data you're supposed to use 100% so I did that.*

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/345762590/#345788357)

*This module is focused on giant people interacting with small people, sometimes personally and sometimes at the scale of cities or larger. It draws on authors like Grildrig (none of his furry writing), Inwiththebooks, jellytea as well a selection other writing sourced from Giantess World. Sizes included vary from mini-gts to tera. This module does contain writing with giant males and giant sex. If you don't want them, my testing suggests giant men don't show up unless you write them in yourself since most of the material doesn't feature them. There is incidental vore and watersports included in the training data but I didn't go out my way for detailed stuff focused on it.*

*There are two tokens you may want to ban if they start causing trouble: a long run of tildes and '."'. I triple checked the data and I know I removed all of the dumb dinkuses including tilde ones, but for some reason the tilde one still comes up. The period-quotation mark thing is because of one longer story I missed fixing up the quotation marks in after txt file conversation. I would rerun the training but I don't have enough tokens left for this billing cycle.*

*I used 2.5 MB of data and 2750 steps.*

*Have fun in The City Anons.*

>He laughed at her comment. "You have no idea how right you are." He took a deep breath as if he were about to say something important. When his eyes met hers again they had changed. They seemed different somehow.
>
>[ Tags: girl-doubts ]
>
>"What is it?" she asked him with trepidation in her voice.
>
>His smile widened and he pulled her into an embrace. "Nothing," he said softly against her hair. His arms tightened around her shoulders and then released her. He looked down at her for a moment and then turned away from her. "Come here," he commanded gently.
>
>She followed him slowly towards the bed and lay back on top of it. Her head rested against one of the pillows and she stared up at him. He knelt between her legs and leaned over her body. Then he pressed his lips against hers and kissed her deeply. A shiver went through her when his tongue entered her mouth. He moved lower until his face hovered above her pussy.
>
>[ Tags: girl-smells ]
>
>The smell of her arousal filled his nostrils and sent another rush of desire coursing through his veins. He inhaled sharply but did not move any closer to her opening. Instead, he ran his hands lightly across her thighs. As he touched her skin, goose bumps rose all along her flesh. His fingers traced every curve and crevice of her legs. Each touch made her nipples harden even more.

*This collects about 40 full-length novels in the harem lit fantasy genre by authors such as Eric Vall, Logan Jacobs, Dante King, Michael Scott Earle, and many more, and trains them at about 45% at 10,000 steps. As far as I know, this is the biggest and most comprehensive such module for the harem fantasy genre.*

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/345615202/#345739616)

*I trained this module on my favourite mind control smut stories (excluding ones with poor quality prose) from various sources, mostly mcstories.com but a few from ASSTR and Literotica.*

*All stories painstakingly cleaned and formatted to have perfect formatting, no blank lines, normalized quote formats etc (took me the whole damn day)*

*What was included:*

- *Focus was mostly on stories about telepathic or magic mind control, rather than "realistic" methods like hypnosis, drugs or brainwashing*
- *I included a handful of loli mc stories from web.archive.org's archive of Piper's Domain, but they made up less than 10% of the total*
- *Decent amount of mc incest*

*What was NOT included:*

- *Male/male sex of any kind. I used entirely straight or lesbian stories. It might work for gay stories regardless but I dunno. If you're not straight you're might not get a lot out of this model, you should easily be able to train your own using an archive like gayspiralstories*
- *Long hypnotic induction scenes. I don't find those hot and I mostly made this for myself, sorry. So if you're looking for a model for induction scenes ("focus on my watch" "you are getting very sleepy" etc.) I would not use this one, because there isn't any of that in the training data*

*\>Is it any good, anon?*

*Don't know yet, I just made it and haven't tested it much. Mind control is fundamentally a NARRATIVE fetish, rather than one about specific sex acts or body types, which makes it tricky for transformers to understand. I find even davinci often struggles to do MC well. It may turn out that 6B isn't enough to be good at it, even with this module. Failure in this case won't mean incoherence, it'll just mean that output isn't any better for MC than default Sigurd. Try it and see how you go*

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/346210503/#346232941)

*Here is the promised mind control induction module. It has been trained on 1MB of excerpts from MC stories, focusing on inductions and similar concepts; these vary in style, tense, perspective, and quality, but hopefully it averages out. I cannot guarantee anything about what it spits out! It does seem to have got the general gist, though obviously it'll need some fiddling and guiding.*

*Unfortunately it seems I did not fully clean the training data, and some �s do appear. I cannot retrain it at the moment as I have ran out of steps; I will do so next month, when I will hopefully have gathered more training data as well.*

>
>Once we got close enough to the shoreline, Nadir began to take off her clothes until she stood naked from head to toe except for one piece of clothing – a leather loincloth that was tied around her waist. It went down just above her knees but left most of her long legs completely exposed in between. She looked like some sort of exotic dancer as she wiggled out of it with ease.
>
>I couldn’t help myself as my eyes wandered over her body once again. Her breasts were large and perfectly round, not too big or small at all. They sat high on her chest and swayed back and forth when she moved. The nipples were thick and dark pink while they poked through her golden brown fur.
>
>Her stomach was flat and tight while there was an indentation right where her belly button would be if she had one. My cock twitched involuntarily at the thought of sliding inside those soft curves.

*Forgive me for not having this out a few Fridays ago. Because no one has released anything like this, I took my own stories, a combination of ye olde AID and NAI and made a Mommy /ss/ module. Is it refined and perfect? No, but it does talk about good boys and pregnant mommies. Apologies for the data being in second (cancer) POV, but it does seem to do something in other perspectives too.*

*Because of the small amount of data, I only used 200 steps for the first iteration. The second one with 500 steps certainly has a stronger effect.*

#### [(V3) Multiple Partners](https://files.catbox.moe/66nz91.module)

[by Magenta.Darkstar (oh shit they're back)](https://discord.com/channels/854479693503660032/870494065446248458/891853043224690718)

*I've been really frustrated with NAI's performance during scenes with multiple partner. I trained a module that consists of FFM, MMF, FFFM, MMMF, and Orgy erotica from Literotica. The results are already substantially better than NAI's typical behavior:*

>[ Scenario: Mike and Dave are going to fuck me at the same time. ]
>
>I had been with both of them before, but I was still inexperienced when it came to sex in general so they were quite gentle as we began making out passionately on our bed. We kissed deeply for a while until finally my hands reached down between us to feel their cocks. They both moaned loudly as I started rubbing one then quickly moving onto the other. Soon each cock was hard enough that they wanted to go inside me right away. So without any further delay or preparation we got into position side by side facing towards each other. Both guys moved closer together and pushed their hips forward slightly allowing themselves room to thrust into me from behind. My pussy lips opened up invitingly and I felt myself being penetrated once again. This feeling alone is an amazing experience!

*For the above I started with just the scenario.*

*I do not recommend you use this as your default basis, but instead use a module with high quality writing until you get to a multiple partner sex scene. Then switch back when the scene is over.*

*Trained on approximately 1000 top-rated stories from LitErotica Dump V1 NonConsent/Reluctance story category. This category is for stories around control. Trained on 8000 steps.*

>**One day,** she would be free.

>She was not sure how long it had been since the first time he'd used her mouth for his pleasure. It seemed like years ago now that she'd met him and gone with him to the beach house in San Diego where they were living at the time. He'd made her wear a bikini when they went swimming; one of those tiny bikinis that barely covered anything. She remembered being embarrassed by all the attention men gave her as they watched them go into the ocean. Her mother warned her about going out there alone, but she didn't listen. When she saw him swim over to her, she thought maybe this time he wouldn't hurt her...maybe this time he would just use her body instead of abusing it.

>He did neither.

*This module was trained on fanfictions and NSFW stories on AO3. It will generate likely very extreme NSFW content.*

*Includes: NSFW, extreme, non-con, scat, watersports, exhibitionism*

#### [(V3) Sexfighting](https://files.catbox.moe/3bpil8.module)

[by L. Horatius Catullus](https://discord.com/channels/870618914323849228/870619535600922644/880421244405710868)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/345503749/#345565971)

*This was made from a mix of shrunken women stories and fairy stories. They were mostly "Giant male"-centric with submissive or lightly resistant woman. It includes writing by The Reducer as well as stuff I liked from Giantess World and Literotica that fit the theme. I can't say that it's perfect when it comes to stuff like insertions that shouldn't happen, but it gives the AI a lot more vocabulary to understand M/f size relationships.*

#### [(V3) Small Horses](https://files.catbox.moe/3ea0vz.module)

*Twenty cleaned-up and formatted stories from various sources trained at ~300%/1k steps. Mixes furries, fanfiction, and original content. Contains tentacles, watersports, vore (both soft and hard/soul), and mild guro—however, these were not the focus of the training material. Mostly F/F and M/F. Contains a disproportionate number of futanari and trans girls.*

*non-con, ear penetration, brain fucking, navel penetration, urethra penetration (female), cervix penetration, nipple penetration, and wound fucking abound*

*(pls pm me if you know a place with brainfuck stories, I literally used every good one from FA and AO3)*

*The complete text of Thomas Malory's Le Morte D'Arthur, edited by Edward Strachey. The data is the same as v1 but has been trained for Sigurd v4 with more steps. 1.7mb, 1170 steps for 60% coverage.*

>**How Sir Percival Came To The Court Of King Arthur**

>THEN SAID PERCIVAL, "WHAT manner of arms hast thou by thee, Sir Knight?"
>
>"Why," said the small knight, "I have a sword and shield, but I know not how I got them."
>
>"Forsooth," said Sir Percival, "meseemeth thou art hurt in thy hand, and therefore I will give thee mine if thou wilt promise me never to draw out that sword against any man's life, but only in battle, or else to defend yourself, and I will forgive you your default."
>
>"Certes," said the little knight, "that I will do, and well I love your worship, for ye are the best knight of all the world, and most courteous and benign."
>
>"Well, sir knight," said Sir Percival, "behold, I charge you keep faith with me, for I am right trusty, and I think no knight alive can be truer than I; and, an ye break faith with me, I will slay you in despite of all the world, and I hold myself excused for that I did not slay you aforetime."
>
>"Nay," said the small knight, "I will keep faith with you, for I love you better than my soul."
>
>So they parted, and Sir Percival rode to Camelot, and told the king of the matter, and the king bade make the small knight welcome, and let bring him into the hall.

##### [Nineteen Eighty-Four](https://files.catbox.moe/2pb5tl.zip)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/359155218/#359495805)

Alright, I guess I just bit the bullet. Here's [four](#nineteen-eighty-four) [of](#george-orwell) [the](#rod-serling) [modules](#western) I made the training data for, trained with Sigurd V4. All four of these are already in the Rentry in their V3 forms, so those would just be updated. Now have names consistent with NAI module naming schemes and also have images coming with the module file. ZIP files contain the module, the training data, the image, and the base for the training data I formatted. So if at some point Sigurd V5 or 22 beaks or whatever the fuck comes out and I'm not there to retrain the modules, you'll have everything you need.

*A module trained with all the novels involving Ezio Auditore - the greatest Assassin. Did you hate something about Assassin's Creed, like Ezio's Family execution? Now you can rewrite his History, or give your own Assassin your Destiny.*

>**Ezio jumped over the rooftops** and landed in a crouch on the other side. He took out his bow, notched an arrow to it, then stood up again.
>
>He saw two figures running towards him from behind the walls of the palazzo: one was holding a sword, the other a dagger. Ezio's first shot missed its target as he had aimed for the throat, but the second hit home and the man fell dead with blood pouring from his neck. As soon as the templars were down, he rushed forward to finish them off, but they disappeared into a doorway before he could reach it. They'd escaped!
>
>But where?
>
>There was no time to waste—he would have to find them quickly or lose them forever. He dashed around the corner and came face-to-face with another pair of men, who looked at him with surprise. It was obvious that neither of them knew what was going on; perhaps they thought he was just some drunken ruffian. But he wasn't about to let himself be taken by surprise again. He drew back his arm and released his arrow in one swift movement. The first man went down clutching at his chest, while the second ran screaming, "Aiuto!"
>
>Ezio chased after him, but the man reached the safety of the nearest house and began pounding on the door. Ezio leapt across the street and grabbed hold of the handle. It opened easily enough, revealing a terrified woman inside. She tried to slam the door shut, but Ezio pushed past her and entered the room. He heard footsteps coming toward him from the far end of the hall. There was nowhere else to hide so he threw open the window and climbed through it onto the roof of the building opposite. His pursuer appeared from the shadows. Ezio put an arrow through his heart.
>
>The assassin slipped silently away, leaving the wounded woman cowering in terror.

*Dunno if this of interest to anyone, but I trained a module on Jonathan Stroud's Bartimaeus Trilogy plus the prequel book. Not sure it works the best because of the perspective switching the book does, but I'm a big fan of the series so I wanted to make this. It would probably be best for succubus/summoning prompts since that's what the series is about.*

*Battlefield: Earth is a 1982 sci-fi novel written by L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology. It's mostly known as the film adaptation, which was called "the worst film made" and won 8 Golden Raspberry Awards.*

>A long, long time ago in a galaxy far, far away...

>The earth was the center of the universe. The sun and moon revolved around it, and everything else did too. There were no people; there was only Adam and Eve, who lived in the Garden of Eden, which was surrounded by an endless ocean of water. Everything was perfect, until one day God took a bite out of the apple that had been given to him by the snake, and gave man the knowledge of good and evil. He then banished Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden, saying: "You may not eat from any tree in this garden." But they disobeyed, and ate from the forbidden fruit. As punishment for their sin, God sent them into exile on Earth, where they would live forever as bees.
>
>This is the story that every child learns when he or she goes to school. And it's all true. Except for the part about the apple. That part isn't true. In fact, I've never even seen an apple. But I know what it looks like because I have read several books written by someone named Mark Twain.

*Bolo is a shared universe series about AI tanks. Not regular tank-sized tanks. Bolos are huge, largest model weights 32,000 tons.*

*I doubt there's much interest for this, but it seems to work sufficiently well. AI occasionally tries to give them human features, but that's usually fixable with retries.*

*Based on the bestselling science fantasy series written by Roger Zelazny. The Amber stories take place in two contrasting "true" worlds, Amber and Chaos, and in shadow worlds (Shadows) that lie between the two. These shadows, including our Earth, are parallel worlds that exist in, and were created from, the tension between opposing magical forces of Amber and Chaos. The Courts of Chaos are situated at the very edge of an Abyss. Members of the royal family of Amber, after walking a Pattern that is central to Amber, can travel freely through the Shadows. While traveling (shifting) between Shadows, one can alter reality or create a new reality by choosing which elements of which Shadows to keep or add, and which to subtract.*

My hands hung limp at my sides; I felt chilled to the bone despite the warmth of this chamber. Even so, my mind continued working feverishly through possibilities; Perhaps it is someone outside trying to get in? Or perhaps he has been here long enough that his presence now matches mine? But how could this have happened unless I entered while asleep?

*The Culture series is a science fiction series Iain M. Banks. The stories centre on The Culture, a utopian society of humanoid aliens, and advanced superintelligences. The main theme of the series is the dilemmas that an idealistic, more-advanced civilization faces in dealing with smaller, less-advanced civilizations that do not share its ideals, and whose behaviour it sometimes finds barbaric. In some of the stories action takes place mainly in non-Culture environments, and the leading characters are often on the fringes of (or non-members of) the Culture, sometimes acting as agents of Culture (knowing and unknowing) in its plans to civilize the galaxy. Each novel is a self-contained story with new characters, although reference is occasionally made to the events of previous novels.*

*I made a Dark Tower (by Stephen King) Module. It's based off the entire book series, properly reformatted for training purposes, so you shouldn't get any weird outputs. It also uses all 8K steps, which was overkill, but I don't have anything else I want to train this month, so fuck it.*

>She waited while Leto pondered those statements. The tension between them was palpable but she did not break away. It would take more than an old woman’s threats to send Leto into action against Duncan Idaho now. As long ago as when they had first met, Idaho knew how much Leto valued loyalty above everything else. And yet…

>He said finally, “If there were any evidence at all which might prove Idaho guilty of something worse than stupidity—if we had even some hint of a pattern connecting him with conspiracies within our own society—you yourself would give him up without hesitation, wouldn’t you, Sister Dorotea? You certainly wouldn’t hesitate over anything pertaining to Paulus Atreides. This matter has nothing to do with Idaho! Nothing!”

*From Wikipedia: Gor is the fictional setting for a series of sword and planet novels written by philosophy professor John Lange, writing as John Norman. The setting was first described in the 1966 novel Tarnsman of Gor. The series is inspired by science fantasy pulp fiction works by Edgar Rice Burroughs (such as the Barsoom series). It also includes erotica and philosophy content. The Gor series repeatedly depicts men abducting and physically and sexually brutalizing women, who grow to enjoy their submissive state. According to The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, Norman's "sexual philosophy" is "widely detested", but the books have inspired a Gorean subculture.*

*This is trained on the first seven books of John Norman’s Gorean saga as these are considered to be the “best”, such as it is. 5.6MB of cleaned up text, 3000 steps.*

*Gotrek Gurnisson, a Dwarf Slayer, and Felix Jaeger, his Human chronicler, are a duo of warriors travelling throughout the length and breadth of the Old World, battling Dark Forces and stopping plots in Gotrek's quest for a heroic death against a terrible foe. The adventures of these warriors have been written down in the series of books: "My Travels with Gotrek" by Master Felix Jaeger, which outlines Felix's many adventures with his maniacal comrade throughout many of their endeavours, recording everything till the day Gotrek has finally met his doom, and will finally be allowed to enter the halls of his ancestors.*

*Covering the Kushiel Saga by Jacqueline Carey, from the first person perspectives of Phedre no Delaney and Imriel de la Courcel; magnificent in breadth and depth.*

*In the series, the Roman Empire (called the Tiberian Empire) had fallen due to internal conflict instead of the Barbarian Invasions and the Germanic peoples were kept at bay to the east of the Rhine (called Rhenus with its Latin name). Paul the Apostle did not live to form Christianity and followers of Jesus (called Yeshua ben Yosef) live as a sect of Messianic Judaism known as the Yeshuites. An offshoot from Yeshuites, led by a descendant of Jesus and his angel companions, had made its foothold in Gaul after a long period of exile and persecution. Their creed based on the apotheosis of early angelic founders predominates in the country now known as Terre d'Ange.*

>**"I am Imriel de la Courcel,** and I will not be spoken of thus!"
>
>"You are a fool," the old woman said in disgust. "A vain, arrogant boy who thinks he is better than his father." She spat on the ground at my feet, then turned her back to me without another word. The others followed suit, leaving only one still standing with us; a young man with dark hair and eyes like black glass, dressed all in green velvet. He stared at me for an instant, as if trying to place where he had seen me before, then nodded curtly to himself and strode away.
>
>He was the last person I saw that day. It took some time ere we reached our destination, which proved to be a small house built into a hollow between two hills, its windows shuttered against the sun. We dismounted outside it, tied up the horses, and went inside. There were no furnishings except for a table and four chairs set about a low fire burning on the hearth. A single lamp burned atop this table. No servants attended us, nor did anyone greet us when we entered.
>
>We waited there in silence while it grew late. After a long period of waiting, the door opened and a tall figure stepped out. Like the rest of them, she wore simple robes of blue wool. Her face was lined but beautiful, ageless, with large grey-green eyes above a wide mouth.
>
>"Well?" she asked impatiently. "What do you want? Why have you come here?"
>
>It seemed to take Elua’s children quite a while to understand what they were doing. They looked from one another uncertainly, unsure how to proceed. Then I spoke first.
>
>"My lady Phèdre nó Delaunay de Montrève has been accused of murder by the Queen Regent of Terre d`Ange," I said simply.
>
>The old woman blinked slowly once. "So?"
>
>"She claims innocence."
>
>Phaedra made a gesture, indicating the other three. "And these people claim otherwise."
>
>There was nothing else to say after that. My heart beat hard within my breast. This was why we came: to prove the truth of our words. If they believed us, then... well, I knew not what would happen next. But if they didn't believe us, then we had done harm enough already. For now, though, there was nothing more to be gained.

>The wagon's wheels clattered on the cobblestones, and then a low rumble sounded as it rolled into motion.
>
>The carriage was black lacquered wood with red leather straps that crossed its back like an ornate saddle. Four matched horses pulled it at a slow walk along the street, their heads down in perfect step. A lone figure sat high up behind them. The hood of his cloak had been thrown back to reveal dark hair, a thin face with a long nose and sharp chin, and eyes so pale they seemed almost white. His hands were folded within the sleeves of his long coat.
>
>Beside him stood two soldiers, one on either side. They wore matching cloaks trimmed in red-and-black fur, and each held a sword at the ready.
>
>Two women rode inside the carriage: the driver, her head bowed, and beside her the man who had spoken earlier. He sat opposite from the woman with the scarred face, while she stared out through the window at the passing city streets. Her gaze seemed fixed upon some distant place, yet her expression was unreadable beneath a veil of shadows.

>On this day, three of those people would die.

>**Coyote** was a great medicine man. He could cure all diseases, and he knew how to make medicines from the roots of many plants. One day when Coyote went hunting in his favorite place on top of Mount Taylor, he found an eagle's nest with four eggs. The mother bird had just laid them, but they were so big that she couldn't carry them away. So Coyote took pity on her and carried one egg home for himself. When it hatched out, it became a beautiful boy who looked exactly like Coyote except that he had wings instead of arms or legs. His name was Eagle Boy.

>Eagle Boy grew up fast and learned everything there was about healing people and curing their illnesses. But because he wasn't human, no one would listen to him. People thought he was crazy, and nobody believed anything he said. Finally Eagle Boy decided to leave this world altogether and become a spirit. So he flew off into the sky until he came to another country where he met a wise old woman named White Buffalo Woman. She told Eagle Boy to go back down below ground and find some good

>A young female mousemaid sat up with a start and stared around in surprise as her eyes adjusted to the darkness. The last thing she remembered was being carried off by those wicked creatures called otters—they had stolen her from under the noses of Redwall Abbey's guards. Now here she was back where it all began; safe but alone on an island surrounded by water! She could hear waves lapping against rocks nearby. There were no trees or bushes anywhere near so how did they get me out? But that didn't matter now. All she wanted to do was go home to Redwall.
>
>The maid stood shakily upright. Her fur cloak lay spread over some kind of mossy log close by. A large red stone lay beside it, half buried beneath leaves and ferns. It looked like one of those stones used for marking boundaries, though this one seemed bigger than most. What was more interesting still, there was writing carved into its face:

>"Dawn is breaking, my friend,

>Sun will soon be shining bright."

>She gazed about in wonderment. "Where am I?"

>"But what about robots?" demanded Anderson. "What can you say of them? They are artificial life-forms---artificial minds---and they are our servants."
>
>Dr. Linquist smiled thinly. "That is where we differ from you Earthmen," he said. "You see your robot as merely mechanical; we know him for what he really is---a living being with his own personality and intelligence. And though I do not believe that any robot has yet achieved true sentience, still, I am certain that someday one will come into existence who will surpass us all.

You men on Earth would destroy yourselves if you did not continually seek new worlds to explore and new conditions under which to live. That is why we are here." He paused and then added, "And it is also why we must destroy ourselves. The Earth is doomed, sir. It is not fit for man to inhabit anymore. Man's only hope lies beyond this planet. If we wish to survive, we must leave it behind forever."

>The High Admiral's eyes widened upon the sight of a space marine storming down one of the hallways towards him. "Where did he come from?" she cried out at first, but her query dissolved as another possessed entered behind their leader.
>
>Moving rapidly through both chambers like a shark fin slicing its way through deep waters, the space marines sought everywhere to kill anything not armored under Imperial colors. Though most regarded them as demons from hell itself, many had never seen one themselves until now. Quickly realizing what their brethren wanted - no quarter given in order to achieve victory - the civilians turned and fled deeper into the cave system, leaving only short-lived resistance to be mopped up by the two companies' scouts already scouring the place.

>After entering the main chamber of the underground complex where the Chaos denizens often conducted their vile rituals, Captain Drakael found it empty except for six rough stone monoliths arranged about an altar in the center of the large room. Upon inspecting the crude carvings decorating some of the stones, the captain could make little sense of what might lie within each piece. There was much jagged imagery depicting creatures that seemed part beast, half human; daemonic shapes with dark, hungry gazes lurking beneath impenetrable hooded expressions on their faces. At least one showed framed over all this a blazing sun hung low above unbreathable skies filled with hideous monsters waving skeletal limbs high overhead while others featured unfortunate souls bound together with chains emerging from a central point.

>*1. When the enemy is about to make a sudden move, feign disorder and confusion; then attack him at unexpected places with an army of half his size.*
>
>*2. If he has sent spies into your country, you must not let them go back alive: execute or drive out all who return without permission from their lord.*
>
>*3. In case of defeat in battle, do not try to flee on foot but save as many horses as possible and get away on horseback.*
>
>*4. Do not forget that a beaten force can always fight again while one still undefeated cannot recover its losses.*
>
>*5. The supreme art of war lies in dominating the situation.*
>
>*6. Let your plans include everything that is likely to happen, for it will probably turn out better than if only what seems best were planned.*
>
>*7. All warfare is based on deception. Hence, when able to deceive our opponent, we are victorious; when unable to deceive him, we are defeated.*
>
>*8. When capable of deceiving others, never tell them anything you do not have to; this makes people trust you.*
>
>*9. Hold jie (trust) sacred and be honest in negotiations.*

#### [(V3) Fate/stay ataraxia](https://files.catbox.moe/o8en07.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/347476303/#347481994)

*Spent way too long extracting scripts from Fate/stay night and Fate/hollow ataraxia and formatting them into something acceptable, but I've finished training a F/sn module.*

*Trained to 100% using 7615 steps. Output is recognizably Nasu-like and inserts Fate characters without prompting.*

*And since I had just enough steps leftover from that,* [*here is a module trained exclusively on the H-scenes.*](https://files.catbox.moe/vnv2gv.module)

*Unfortunately it doesn't spontaneously generate seafood metaphors. Probably need Tsukihime scenes to receive mollusks.*

#### [(V3) Fate/Zero](https://files.catbox.moe/932m9n.module)

*This module was trained on the Fate series books. Specifically:*

- Fate/Zero
- Lord El-Melloi II Case Files
- Fate ⁄ Labyrinth
- Fate ⁄ Zero Another Story - Heart of Freaks
- Fate ⁄ Requiem
- Clock Tower 2015

*This module was trained by me on request of @rando who provided the books and did some basic cleaning. I also did some basic cleaning and used the Dumb Text Reformatter too, as well as some regex stuff.*

*It was trained with approx ~3500 steps to 80%. Sorry, I'm a bit of a dumbass and forgot to make a note of specifically how many steps. But I have a loss graph!*

> He was thinking of something quite different from a crow.
>
> The city below was shrouded in darkness. A thick fog spread over it, and only a few lights could be seen. The light of those few lamps seemed to shine through the heavy mist, but they were still far away from each other. It was like looking at an old photograph with the focus not right - everything seemed blurry.

>
> He had been here before, when he came to rescue El-Melloi's corpse. But then, that time it wasn't night; there was sunlight all around him. Now, however...
>
> There was no sunlight. There was just mist. No matter what direction Kiritsugu looked, the scenery didn't change. It felt as if he was trapped in some kind of hellish world.
>
> In the end, even I can't stand this place...he thought.
>
> Even though his body was wrapped in a black coat, Kiritsugu couldn't hide the fact that he was trembling. The mist covered his entire body, making it hard for him to breathe. His skin prickled from cold, and sweat ran down his forehead.

> This is bad.

>**I grabbed my sword's hilt**, but before I could even swing it, a large mass of metal slammed into me from behind. It felt like someone had hit me with an iron bar and threw me to the ground. The impact caused the air around me to shimmer as if I was standing in front of a powerful wind storm. As I lay on the ground trying to get my bearings, I saw the shadow of a man-like figure looming over me. He looked down at me with his eyes glowing red, then he pulled back his arm to strike again. Before he could, however—
>
>"Stop!"
>
>The voice that echoed through the night sounded familiar to me, but I couldn't quite place it. Then, just as suddenly as it came, the attack stopped. I slowly sat up, rubbing my head where I'd been struck by the man's fist. Looking around, I realized that we were surrounded by several men dressed in black armor. They all wore hoods that covered their faces except for their eyes. There were six of them surrounding us, each holding a long spear or sword. Each of them had the same red glow in their eyes that I'd seen earlier.
>
>"What do you want?" one of them asked, staring at me with his crimson gaze. "We don't know who you are."
>
>I didn't answer right away. After taking a moment to gather my thoughts, I stood up and brushed off my clothes. My body still ached from the blow, but I tried not to let it show as I took a step forward, pushing aside my doubts about whether they would actually help me. Maybe this is what they're here for... to capture me? Or maybe they wanted to kill me outright. I wouldn't put it past them. I'm not sure how many people knew I was coming here, but I couldn't imagine anyone else knowing. Even so, I couldn't be too careful. I needed to find out more.

>**The beast screamed at me** as I ran past, but the wind from my blade cut through its skin and muscle like a hot knife through butter. The beast's howl of pain was deafening in the enclosed space, echoing off the stone walls around us. My mind went blank as I focused on the task at hand—killing this monster before it killed me. I spun my blade again, slashing at the beast's neck while leaping over its back to avoid another attack from behind. It turned and tried to snap at me with its teeth, but I managed to dodge by jumping into the air and kicking out with both legs at the same time, sending the creature flying backward into the wall. The impact caused cracks to form in the stone, which quickly spread outward as the beast bounced off it several times until finally slamming against the far wall and falling limp onto the ground where it lay still.
>
>I stood there for a moment, panting heavily, my breath coming in ragged gasps as I struggled to regain control of myself. My heart was racing so fast that I could feel each beat pounding in my ears. Sweat dripped down my forehead and stung my eyes as I looked down at the beast lying dead on the floor. There was no doubt in my mind that it had been one of the monsters I'd seen in the visions, but I couldn't help feeling disappointed. Maybe I just wanted to kill something because it felt good to do so? This wasn't exactly the first time I'd killed someone, after all...

> **Covering her slender body was** a black dress. It had an elegant design, but the sleeves were too long and it looked like she'd be cold if she wore that alone in this weather.
>
>"I'm sorry." I apologized to Kamito who stood beside me. "You're going out with Claire today?"
>
> "...Yes," he replied curtly. He didn't seem very happy about it either. The two of them hadn't been talking much lately. I could tell from his attitude. They probably weren't getting along well.
>
> Kamito glanced at my face for some reason before turning away sharply. What's wrong? Is there something bothering him?
>
> —It must have been because of what happened yesterday. After all, we found out that Rinslet and Ellis' relationship wasn't as perfect as they claimed... Although it would be better not to think about such things.
>
> The sun rose higher into the sky while making its way towards noon. We arrived at the church where the ceremony was taking place around ten minutes later.
>
> We entered through the main entrance and walked up the stairs. Along the stone steps, small flowers bloomed in vases placed on pedestals. A faint scent of incense floated over everything. This kind of atmosphere seemed more fitting than anything else for a wedding.

*8000 (~163%) steps on volumes 1~17 of Konosuba's light novels. Done with epub2txt2 and the formatting tool in the OP to remove double linebreaks. There are probably a few quirks to fix in the original text: I removed anything like table of contents and any afterwords, but a few other things may have slipped past. It was a rush since my sub renews tonight. Do not abuse goddesses and chuunis.*

*What do you get when a cynical ex-NEET reborn in another world forms a party with an airheaded water goddess, a masochistic crusader, and a minmaxing archwizard? Konosuba!*

*Work on this began when I realized that the previous Rentry module splits sentences with linebreaks. The Yen Press light novel volumes were also used instead of fan translations, and coverage was decreased from 163% to 100% to avoid overfit. This should increase output coherency.*

*The files were converted with Calibre, then cleaned under the Datasetting Guide with Gnurro's FineTuneReformatter and Zermelane's 'Dumb Reformatter.' Many thanks to DrYazman for generously donating their steps.*

*I scraped and formatted like 80ish percent of CoC2, which turned out to be like 3.4mb of text. I haven't trained it yet since there's more that needs to be added.
There are some questionable aspects about the text since there are so many repeated instances of a placeholder "player character" name, so I have no idea how it will behave once trained.
Also it cracks me up that just the sex/dialog scenes in that game add up to a higher character count than the Bible. (I elected not to add in the repetitive environmental descriptions from the overworld maps)*

*A few notes:*

- *I changed the main character's name to "Anon"*
- *I was nondiscriminatory with the scenes I added. Basically if it was an option in the novel portion of the gameplay, it was selected and added regardless of my personal tastes.*
- *There may be scenes missing or overlooked-- it was a haphazard process. I'll keep working on this and post my own version at some point in the future.*

#### [(V3) Sex and Marmota Nights](https://files.catbox.moe/5fxj3v.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/348150249/#348183171)

*So far this has been one of my most effective models. Trained on a choose your own adventure(I know. Use 2nd person.) called "Marmota Nights" or "Sex and Sex Again". The game didn't get very far development wise but what was there amounted to 1mb of non romanticized incest. The module makes scenes feel less like generic overdone porn and more like authentic taboo encounters. I reccomend using the vegetables preset, but the others have worked well enough.*

*The game is long abandoned, but available [here](https://icarusdragon.blogspot.com/) and I recomend the version [here](https://icarusdragon.blogspot.com/2015/10/helloeveryone-aspromised-here-it-is-sex.html)*

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/345503749/#345526302)

*Okay folks, this is a module trained on one of those epic fanfictions, specifically from the anime Ah! My Goddess. It's infamous for being the equivalent of 18 novels (120,000 words each).*
*The fanfiction itself is named "Trial by Tenderness"*

*Featuring [transcripts from episodes 1 to 194 of the podcast "Welcome to Night Vale"](http://www.nightvalepresents.com/transcripts), a radio show about a fictional desert town where strange things happen on a daily basis and are regarded as totally normal.*

*This first version still creates some weird results as can be seen below but I'm not entirely sure if that's due to the training data, the parameters or the AI itself. 2.8MB, 2300 steps, 75% coverage*

>**[Cecil enters the studio hurriedly. He fumbles with the mic. Rattling and shuffling of papers can be heard.]**

>**[Breathlessly]**
>
>**Listeners, I have some very important news for you. You see, when I was on my way to the studio just now,**
>there were two men in a car who pulled up next to me and flashed their headlights at me as if they wanted to tell me something but it wasn't clear what that thing might be. And then one man leaned out his window and yelled: “I’m Cecil! That’s Cecil! The guy from the radio show! Get him! Get him before he gets us all!”
>
>And so here we are. We must assume these men are dangerous and that this is an emergency situation. In fact, I am going to call them back right now. Listen carefully because you may not get another chance. Hello? Are you still there? Yes, hello again listeners. This is Cecil. It's good to hear your voice. Let me start by saying, don't worry about anything. Everything will work itself out. Now listen closely. These men are following me. They're driving around behind me in a silver sedan. If you look over towards where I'm standing, you'll notice they've parked directly across the street from me. They've been tailing me ever since I left home earlier today. Just like I said, everything will turn out alright.

### [Annotated Writing](https://files.catbox.moe/rxvq1j.module)

[by Magenta.Darkstar](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/911277636179873893)

*A follow up from Director's View and Sentiments&Summaries, this is a module for directing the story with annotations. Aligns well with [lion's Pocket Notes](https://rentry.co/biases#pocket-notes), supporting Describe, Do, Dialogue, Setup, Start1, Start3, and Plot.*

    [ Genre: Space Opera. ]
    [ Plot: adventure, romance. ]
    In the year 2057, a new star is discovered in the constellation of Orion. A small group of scientists and politicians are sent to investigate it. They find an alien spacecraft that has crashed into the Earth's atmosphere. The aliens have been living on our planet for centuries, but they are now dying out due to their own biology...

    ***
    [ Start1: Willow, human, female. ]
    Willow was born on a farm near the village of Greenfield. She was raised by her father, mother, and brother. Her parents worked hard to provide food and shelter for their family. They did not want to burden their children with debt or worry.

    [ Describe: me. ]
    I am Willow. I am a slave.
    My name is Willow. My life is worth nothing.
    When I was a child, my father told me stories about the world.

    [ Do: I look for a way to escape. ]
    One night, when the moon was full, the guards brought me to the auction block.

    [ Dialogue: The queen tells me, "You're pretty, for a human." ]
    Every day, the servants brought me a meal. Sometimes they served me food that I'd never tasted before.

    ***
    [ Setup: A cool winds blows over an icy vale. ]
    In the middle of winter, a traveler was walking through a snowy valley. He was a tall man, dressed in furs. His face was covered by a black hood. He carried a staff in his left hand, and a large pack on his back.

### [Stand Up Routines](https://files.catbox.moe/2gt8t1.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/359507552/#359655371)

*It's amateur hour at the /aids/ comedy club. and Sigurd is ready to do some stand-up. Although, he might struggle to actually form any kind of jokes.*

*Anyway, this stand-up routine module was trained at 35% on stand-up routine from many famous stand-ups (And some amateur thrown in as well.). With the goal of making Sigurd produce a stand-up routine that might give you one giggle before you realize that AIs are not any good at writing jokes.*

### [(V3) Advertisements](https://files.catbox.moe/ve8atp.module)

[by NotFemale](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/872202076934004736)

*A glimpse into the dystopian future of AI generated advertising. Burned 800 steps on 700 KB of TV and radio spots to make this stupid module. Special thanks to  TravelingRobot for pointing me to a dataset. High randomness recommended so Sigurd mashes advertisements together.*

>**I was there, the day Horus slew the Emperor.** You may remember me as one of the many thousands who were in the crowd. I'll never forget that night; not the roar, or the fear; not the pain, or loss. No, those things are just symbols. The only real thing to be remembered is my first kill. A lion. An act which changed my world. And yet you don't know what it means... to hunt.
>
>The world has gone through a revolution. It is no longer enough simply to build. To survive and succeed now requires a total commitment to your art, a passion for innovation. For the next generation's greatest work. And this is our pledge to you... from Ford... a full spectrum of vehicles that are designed to make life more enjoyable, more exciting. Because when life's fun-a Ford!

### [(V3) The Club](https://files.catbox.moe/l6uggu.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/350292737/#350296625)

![Example](https://files.catbox.moe/6fiig4.png)
{: .center}

*(formerly known as "Prompt Module")*

*I bought another 10k steps to train on the entirety of the club. This time with proper formatting. Sections are seperated by the @ symbol, so you can ban that token to keep it on track.*

*Originally intended to generate prompts from tags, but it seems to be able to do more than that. It can work with full stories fine. It is good at second person. It "knows" a lot about what people want from AI stories and how text should be formatted. So I think it makes a good default module.*

### [(V3) Director View](https://files.catbox.moe/rc35sx.module)

[by Magenta.Darkstar *(kek)*](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/888106076619300885)

*Okay, this module was trained on a large corpus of Writing Prompts.*

*The format for use is:*

    [ Prompt: <Something neat happens> ]
    <prompt response>

*This can be used in two different ways. The first is when starting a new story you can direct the scene. The second is when you are in the middle of a story you can provide direction for the AI.*

*For example:*

    They were not the only ones looking for a way out of the Inner Sphere. Skye had seen similar ships pass through the system before. There was a steady stream of them coming and going. Some were filled with refugees, others were full of contraband. They all looked for ways to leave the Inner Sphere.
    The captain came down to check on the passengers. He was a man named Phezzan. Skye thought he looked like a typical mercenary. His face was hard and expressionless.
    [ Prompt: Skye needs to blend in with the other passengers. ]
    Skye stood up and walked over to the captain. She smiled at him and said, "I'm sorry, but I need to use your bathroom."
    Phezzan nodded and gestured to the door. Skye went into the small room and closed the door behind her. She turned around and saw that the door was locked. She reached into her pocket and pulled out a small device. She pressed a button on the side and the lock clicked open.
    Skye opened the door and stepped outside.

*Make sure to provide appropriate context switching with the prompt. If you are intending to have a new scene I recommend.*

    ***
    [ Prompt: <intended scene> ]

*It can be combined with Scene and Scenario for stronger direction.*

    ***
    [ Scene: In the cargo hold of the  Lyran freighter. ]
    [ Scenario: Skye needs to blend in with the other passengers. ]
    [ Prompt: Aboard the spacecraft Skye socially manipulates her wat to the bridge. ]
    Skye was a tall woman, but she was still shorter than most of the other passengers. She wore a black jumpsuit and a pair of dark sunglasses. Her hair was short and blonde. She had a small nose and a thin mouth. She had a very pale complexion.
    She walked up to the captain and said, "Excuse me, sir. I'm looking for a place to hide."
    The captain looked at her suspiciously. "What do you want?"
    "I need to hide," Skye repeated.

*The strongest measurable effect I can see from doing this is that when you enter Prompt: it doesn't treat the text as having been "written". So without this module Prompt: A bomb goes off. may respond with something like The sound of the explosion rocked my ears thus assuming that A bomb goes off was part of the text. Using this module shouldn't do that.*

*Experimenting you absolutely can write a full coherent story using just the Scene/Scenario/Prompt/\*\*\* keywords.*

### [(V3) DND Monster Generator](https://files.catbox.moe/9436dx.module)

[by Elle](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/883558092732792843)

Basically I scraped DND 5e and 4e for Monster Manual entries, it has some nice outputs that could work as actual stats

> Race: Human
>
> Class: Wizard
>
> Level: 10
>
> Title: President of the United States

*An experiment I ran for fun. Two modules, one trained on 20.5k lines of complex generated equations containing decimal arguments, the other trained on 30k lines of generated equations containing integer arguments and only the basic operators  +, -, \*, /, and ().*

### [(V3) Pokédex](https://files.catbox.moe/xoh3jy.module)

[by lion](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/872058262000894012)

*A module trained on highly detailed data for every species of Pokémon, including all regional and mega forms. This module is functionally a Pokémon Generator and can output never before seen Pokémon if you prompt the AI with Name: or Description:. Special thanks to Zaltys for his hard work preparing the dataset!*

*For example with the prompt Name: Lion*

>**Name: Lion**
>
>Level: 40
>
>EV Gained: HP, Special Attack, Speed
>
>LV 4 Stats (MAX): 252/252 (+6), 102/102 (-2), 100/100(-1)
>
>\- Brave Bird
>
>\- Roar
>
>HP EVs into Defense to raise its bulk and defense. It also helps lower the risk of status ailments. The special attack is for a bit more power when fighting in groups. Speed allows it to close on opponents quickly.
>
>Description: Lion is a large quadrupedal Pokémon with red fur and yellow stripes on its back. Its ears are long and pointed, while it has two small black spots near the tip of each ear. It also has a white mane that hangs down past its neck, and it has three pairs of orange eyes with green irises. On top of its head sits an elongated horn that curves up to its forehead, giving it a triangular shape overall.

*You can also try different prompts as it is quite flexible in generating stat blocks and fantasy creature descriptions.*

### [(V3) Python](https://files.catbox.moe/54vv1t.module)

*I just trained this on [a bunch of random python code](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python) as an experiment and it worked better than I expected. ~1.3MB(I think), 1380 steps, 99.99% coverage*

### [(V3) Sentiments and Summaries](https://files.catbox.moe/9hoy02.module)

[by Magenta.Darkstar](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/899489848656818176)

*A module designed to give authorial direction to the AI about the content and feeling to be expressed by a passage. Done by specifying [ Sentiment: X. ] or [ Summary: Y.] Trained sentiments: joy, surprise, anger, fear, disgust. Others may work.*

*All training data has had relatively high confidence emotional sentiments tagged and summaries written for blocks of textbooks that contain large paragraph blocks. This included automation and manual summary post-hoc curation. The sentiment tagging was done with a neural network classifier, and the summaries were written by a transformer (substantially less powerful than GPT).*

*The training text includes annotated versions of:*

- *Future Feeling by Joss Lake*
- *This Is How It Always Is by Laurie Frankel*
- *Trans-Galactic Bike Ride_Feminist Bicycle Science Fiction Stories of Transgender and Nonbinary Adventurers by various authors*
- *Antikythera - Shears*

- *Scientist's Thesis - Rationalising Death*
- *Sophronius - The Need to Become Stronger*
- *Three Worlds Collide by Eliezer Yudkowsky*
- *WhatWouldEnderDo - r Animorphs The Reckoning*
- *Short stories by alexanderwales*
- *Tales of Space and Time by HG Wells*
- *The King of Elfland's Daughter by Lord Dunsany*

### [(V3) World Generator](https://files.catbox.moe/zswaxs.module)

[by lion](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/875932866293415946)

*Trained on many varying descriptions of locations, races, classes, factions, characters, worlds, and many other entries, this utility module serves to generate content for lorebooks of any and all kinds. Special thanks to Pause for supplying some excellent tagged lorebook examples to help diversify the content of this module a bit more.*

*The module was trained for ~85 steps which was roughly a little over 64%. It's a small dataset but by keeping the training under 100%, it focuses text heavily towards content generation whilst still providing enough breathing room for Sigurd to improvise and draw from the vast content of its existing fine-tune dataset.*

>\*\*\*
>
>The city of R'lyeh lies on the edge of a vast desert. The climate is dry, hot and unforgiving, its streets paved with glass and made from some kind of strange metal. There are no trees or plants in this place; it's too arid for that. Instead, there are large buildings built out over the sand dunes to keep them cool during the day.

>\*\*\*
>
>[ Type: Class; Genre: Science Fantasy; Tags: Music, Hunter ]
>
>The Hunters are a people of the forest and their culture revolves around hunting. They believe that nature is sacred and should be respected at all times. Their society is based on tribalism with each tribe having its own territory to hunt in. The hunters have developed various ways to track down prey with sound such as using echolocation or by mimicking animal calls to lure them into traps.

*Works most reliably at the start of a new scenario or on a newline after a dinkus (\*\*\*). Try including some data encapsulated in brackets (as seen in the above examples) if you want to steer the generation in a specific direction.*

*Recommended keywords are Type, Name, Input, Genre, Tags, Species, Size, and Setting, though feel free to experiment and try different things as I've surprised myself a few times by what was generated. This is especially the case when used in tandem with other generator modules like the Pokédex module*

### [(V3) Yōkai](https://files.catbox.moe/8x9w18.module)

[by AvoWizard](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/883934323596742706)

*Trained on every entry on yokai.com.*

>**TRANSLATION: the blue flame lantern**
>
> APPEARANCE: The name of this yōkai is derived from a type of Japanese candle called “bou”. These candles are made out of clay and dipped in wax before being lit, giving them an eerie glow. This particular kind of yōkai has no eyes or mouth—it merely floats around like a ghostly orb of light. It can be found on street corners, at shrines, and inside homes during night time. There are many different legends surrounding it; some say that its shape represents fire spirits, while others claim it to be a spirit of darkness sent by gods.
>
> LEGENDS: Some stories tell of children who have been cursed by their parents for not doing well enough in school. As punishment they were forced to walk home through dark streets alone at night. When they arrive back home, however, there will always be a bō hanging outside waiting for them. If you try to take one with you, the flames within will burn your hands until you drop it. Other tales describe how if you touch a bō, then go somewhere else and come back later, you will find that it was gone.
>
> INTERACTIONS: Bōs spend most of their lives floating about without any form of movement. They only appear when someone approaches them. Those who see these orbs often report having seen people walking past them but never looking up. Many believe that they must have looked directly at the bō and therefore did not notice it. Others speculate that perhaps the orb itself is so small that it blends into the scenery and looks as though it is simply part of the background. Once someone does look down upon it, however, it becomes apparent that something strange is going on. People who do catch sight of the bō experience intense pain, which quickly spreads throughout their bodies. Sometimes the pain can even cause paralysis.
