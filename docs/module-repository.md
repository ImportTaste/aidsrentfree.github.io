# /aids/ Rent-Free Module Repository

Alright, let's do this again.

Just like the [other](https://rentry.co/settings) [two](https://rentry.co/lorebooks) rentries, this one serves to be a not-on-discord log of notable NovelAI modules that Anons and others create.

All the questions you'd need answered about the concept can be found on NAI's [medium blogpost](https://novelai.medium.com/custom-ai-modules-dbc527d66081), but I expect more information to come out as we continue experimenting with this feature.

Need help with forming your own dataset? Check the [Unofficial NovelAI wiki's page](https://naidb.miraheze.org/wiki/Datasetting_for_AI_Modules) on the matter.

#### [Published Authors](#writers)

##### [Charles Dickens](https://files.catbox.moe/pq9lqe.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/347254891/#347266948)

*Trained off the text of Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Carol", "A Tale of Two Cities", "Great Expectations", "Little Doritt", and "Oliver Twist"*

##### [C. S. Lewis](https://mega.nz/file/ESB0VJ6Z#Y31SF_GG4VefJXSmFNBs3WgB0yEGTAQ8S-kPeS43W8M)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/345503749/#345504083)

*My CS Lewis module is complete.*

*Training data was all of the major fiction works:*

- *Narnia (7 books)*
- *Space Trilogy (3 books)*
- *The Screwtape Letters*
- *The Great Divorce*
- *Pilgrim's Regress*
- *Til We Have Faces: A Myth Retold*

*Plus a small amount of non-fiction:*

- *Mere Christianity*
- *The Four Loves*
- *The Weight of Glory*

*I had about 2000 steps left over that I could have used to include more of his non-fiction books, but I was concerned that including too much of it would drown out the fiction in terms of effect on the AI's output. I might try a fiction-only version next month when my steps reset.*
*The results seem pretty great so far, better than I expected. Let me know how you get on with it.*

##### [Franz Kafka](https://files.catbox.moe/6gwcym.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/345503749/#345510501)

*Ever want to lose yourself in a maze of surreal bureaucracies? Now you can with the Kafka module! Trained off of:*

- *Collected Stories*
- *Amerika*
- *The Trial*
- *The Castle*

##### [George Orwell](https://mega.nz/file/iqI2AJQJ#u-RpEIiP0Mik-9oK9xflq9cq331BBBdEFVMpjljZQwI)

[by](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/347718642/#347813685) [Anons](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/347951663/#347987649)

*Someone suggested to do this as a module. Done.*

##### [Hunter S. Thompson](https://files.catbox.moe/klnhls.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/346069285/#346168134)

*Hunter S. Thompson works. It includes:*

- *Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas*
- *Hell's Angels*
- *Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72*
- *The Rum Diary*
- *The Curse of Lono*
- *Screwjack & Other Stories**

##### [J. R. R. Tolkien](https://files.catbox.moe/8mazpc.module)

[by untouch](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/870472647383867412)

*The full text of The Hobbit, Lord of The Rings and The Silmarillion.*

##### [Jane Austen](https://files.catbox.moe/v8g63f.module)

[by GelatinousLunch](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/879348810550231090)

*A module from all of Jane Austen major novels and the unfinished Sanditon. The first was trained to 100% and the second to 30%, so the former is good for living in the worlds of the novels, a la Lost in Austen, while the latter sticks a little less closely to the characters and locations from the novels.*

*(4.4 mb, ~4000 steps, 100% coverage)*

[30% Trained ver.](https://files.catbox.moe/m77dti.module)

##### [Oscar Wilde](https://files.catbox.moe/ojdf8x.module)

[by Jorgith Blastercrotch](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/871265822704803910)

*Trained on selected works such as The Picture of Dorian Gray, Poems and Poems in Prose*

##### [Rod Serling](https://files.catbox.moe/fktkh3.zip)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/345503749/#345504110)

*The Rod Serling module. Trained on:*

- *Stories from the Twilight Zone*
- *More Stories from the Twilight Zone*
- *New Stories from the Twilight Zone*
- *Night Gallery*
- *Night Gallery 2*

*Those were the only ones I could find easily. I think The Season To Be Wary would've fit in well as well, but I couldn't find it. Maybe that's for V2 of the model, if that will become a thing. Anyway, I decided to include all my files with the module, so you get the original ebooks I used, the original parsing in plaintext that Pandoc made, and my final edited text files that I used for the training. Maybe it's interesting for someone to see how the module was made. Note: I had an ebook that combined the three Twilight Zone books into one, so there's three ebooks in total.*

##### [Shirley Jackson](https://files.catbox.moe/k37k7r.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/348150249/#348193395)

*A collection of horror and mystery novels by Shirley Jackson. 5.1MB 1500 steps, 26.53% coverage*

>\*\*\*
>
>The moment she opened the door to her apartment, a wave of heat and light hit her. The sun was setting behind the building across from hers, but it still managed to illuminate everything inside. She could see every detail in the room: the bare white walls; the kitchen counter with its old-fashioned wooden cabinets; the framed poster on the wall that said "I My Mom." It had been there for as long as she'd lived here—she remembered when she'd gotten it at an art fair downtown. A small smile played over her lips. She loved this place. This neighborhood. And most importantly, she loved her mom.
>
>She walked into the living room and dropped her bag by the couch. Her mother's voice came through the open window.
>
>"You're home!" she yelled out.
>
>Alexandra took off running down the hall.
>
>"Hey, sweetie!"

##### [Stephen King](https://files.catbox.moe/bn2trc.module)

[by guywhoknowsnothing](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/870565908735725591)

*Inspired by the works of author Stephen King.*

##### [Tom Clancy](https://files.catbox.moe/4eeiam.module)

[by guywhoknowsnothing](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/871492756793606184)

*Inspired by the works of author Tom Clancy.*

##### [Vladimir Nabokov](https://files.catbox.moe/o1o8kg.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/345503749/#345507380)

*Updated my Nabokov module to include the rest of his English language novels, except for Pale Fire and Ada or Ardor. Also cleaned it up a bit so some of the wonkiness present in the first version should no longer occur.*

*Here's a module that's trained off of Nabokov using the following, formatted using the training guide:*

- *Lolita*
- *Pnin*
- *Speak, Memory*

*Results seem solid thus far.*

***

#### [Web Authors](#writers)

##### [Benjamin R. "Yahtzee" Croshaw](https://files.catbox.moe/t8dbtp.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/345615202/#345707116)

*Zero Punctuation module. Trained on (nearly) all of Yahtzee's Zero Punctuation series (at time of training), from The Darkness to Cruelty Squad. ~5.6k steps, 10MB of data. Not pornographic but will probably produce NSFW results [(pic related)](https://files.catbox.moe/ub4194.png)*

##### [Joe Forest](https://www.mediafire.com/file/jfj4hj2bufz219n/Joe+Forest.module/file)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/348541970/#348588994)

*Anyone here into any of the stuff Joe Forest writes? He's the dude that made the SLUT Academy HTML/Twine game if you're familiar with that. It's pretty degenerate shit TF, preg, bestiality, MTF, Even weirder TF like vaginas turning into their canine equivalents, but I figure someone here is as depraved as I am.*

*I trained a Novel AI module with all of his stuff, including his HTML games. Though I left out Lost Property, and his RPGM game.*

*I haven't done much to test if it works all that great or not, but I had the AI write out some terms and character descriptions of things/people that are in the stories to see if it caught on to some of it. For the most part, they seem to be somewhat close to what they are in the stories, with some obvious AI weirdness mixed in. Some of them can be hit or miss though. I think it's dependent on how long a given story is and how much a given term appears in it. So it failed on some obscure ones, but also got some of them pretty close. It's hit or miss.*

*I'm not really sure how well it does at writing smut yet in an actual story, but for what it's worth, I pressed enter on a blank prompt and it went head first into generating a sex scene.*

*I'm new to training the AI though, so I only went for 100% of the training (so about 1500 steps), I don't really know if that's enough or not.*

##### [Prinny](https://files.catbox.moe/d669ox.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/345358791/#345486924)

*This module is based on my [favorite monster/human female unwilling/erotic vore author](https://aryion.com/g4/gallery/PrinnyDood).*

##### [Slutty](https://files.catbox.moe/l97u6x.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/345503749/#345507380)

*Here is my module, based off [SlutWriter's entire catalogue of original works](https://archiveofourown.org/users/SlutWriter/pseuds/SlutWriter/works?fandom_id=2692) and hopefully lending to a more descriptive NSFW writing style.*

##### [Action Movies](https://files.catbox.moe/91n3eo.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/346359371/#346360287)

*I've trained a module on screenplays for action movies. 1.6 MB, 2000 steps.*

>A huge explosion rocks the streets of Los Angeles. The shock wave ripples outward across the entire city. Buildings topple. Fires rage. Smoke billows high into the air. All over town, windows shatter. Bricks fall from buildings and crash to the pavement below.
>
>The Man watches everything happen. Finally, he begins walking towards the center of the city. It will take time for word of this disaster to spread throughout the region. By then, however, he has already made his way deep inside the heart of downtown L.A.

##### [Ancient Rome](https://files.catbox.moe/5g7xj2.module)

[by OccultSage](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/873459667710390332)

*Intended to introduce inspiration by Ancient Rome, this draws from books written by Colleen McCullough and classics such as I, Cladius, with epic battles by legionaries against the barbarians as gladiatorial spectacles. Political intrigue abound!*

>**Rome! The greatest city in the world, and my home.** I would rather die than leave it."
>
>"I understand," said Caesar coldly. "You are a patriot as well as an opportunist; you will not be happy anywhere else. But that is your own affair." He turned to me again. "So we have decided: the three of us shall stay together for one year only. We need time to decide what our next step should be."
>
>"If there were more men like you two around, perhaps Rome could still stand!" Antonia spoke with feeling. She was very beautiful at this moment, her face flushed from wine or excitement, but she looked tired too. Her eyes seemed haunted by some memory, though whether good or bad she did not say.
>We had been talking about politics all evening. It was clear now why Pompey's letter had caused such dismay among his supporters.

##### [AR Video Game Reality](https://files.catbox.moe/kjktjl.module)

[by SGreen](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/875006896862548059)

*Is this the real life is this just a game? It's both. Dive into a reality, where Video Games are the real life.*

>**"This is the next quest, I have to win against Super Mario in a fist fight" I say, before facing Mario.** "I'll take him down if it's the last thing I do."
>
>The game starts and I see that this time my opponent is Yoshi! He has three lives left so he can't die yet. And his first move was to throw me off balance by throwing fireballs at me from behind.
>
>Now we're both running around the map trying to catch each other up. He's going for the flag, while I'm trying to avoid his attacks. Then he throws another fireball but misses and I manage to grab it and use it to attack back. But then Yoshi comes right out of nowhere with a big jump kick and knocks me into the air!
>
>He catches me and throws me across the screen, knocking me out of bounds. Now I'm on the edge of the map and there are no more flags or items nearby. So now what? It looks like I've lost. But wait... Yoshi has only one life left! If I knock him out here, he dies too.
>
>Yoshi sees this coming and jumps over to where I am lying on the ground. I get ready to knock him away again, when suddenly he turns into a mushroom! Then he flies straight through the wall and disappears. The game ends as soon as Yoshi loses all his lives.
>
>I look up at the clock and see that I just barely beat him in time. Yoshi gets 3 points and I get 5. This makes my total score 30 points.

##### [Beastars](https://files.catbox.moe/a9an3f.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/348541970/#348673138)

*This is my first time training a module with a lot of data so I would like any comments and/or criticisms from those who are interested. It's only been trained off of the best rated stories off of AO3, about fifty or so stories which adds up to 7.43 MB of data. Trained to 34%, exactly 3000 steps.*

##### [Classic Cyberpunk](https://files.catbox.moe/9v2y8w.module)

[by TravelingRobot](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/879362003355983902)

*Get you leather jackets and shades to step out into the neon-filled sprawls of the near future! Trained on classic cyberpunk work, mostly from the 80s. So expect more of a retro-Cyberpunk experience. The cyberpunk genre is a bit hard to pin down, and I selected broad selection of works. So this might need a bit of handholding at first to produce the themes you are going for. I do not have time to extensively test modules at the moment, so if you end up using this feel free to ping me about your experiences with the module!*

*5.52MB, 2000 steps, 31% coverage*

>Ghost walked into Club Penumbra and let the beat fill him. He wished he wasn't hunting business.
>
>The last thing he wanted was to be caught in a firefight, but that's what you got for going after an old man who doesn't want to die yet.
>
>He looked around at the other people dancing or just standing there watching the music play. They were all so young: most of them hadn't even been born when Ghost had started out as a street punk on the West Coast. You could tell they didn't know any better; their clothes weren't too different from those worn by his own generation back then.

*The module can generate pretty amazing Cyberpunk output, but **IMPORTANT: you have to add [ Genre: Cyberpunk ] to the A/N.** There is definitely a huge difference between default and this module, even if you need to add the Genre, I tested it.*

>**Mike arrived at the black market bar** with a bad feeling. The place was called "The Overlook", and it had been a popular meeting spot for local hackers and pirates for years, but lately Mike had noticed that some of its clientele seemed to be showing up with bruises and worse on their faces. He'd tried asking around about it once or twice, but nobody wanted to talk in public. Some people were scared of what might happen if they got involved; others just didn't want to know.
>
>It wasn't hard to find out where the trouble was coming from. It started at the door, as usual. A pair of bouncers, big men with shaved heads and matching tattoos across their cheeks. They stood there like statues, watching the crowd come and go through an eye-slit in the middle of each helmet. No one got past them without being scanned and IDed by a small box on their belt. You could argue about whether this made you safer, or just more visible. If anyone did try anything stupid, the bouncers would take care of it. Nobody argued.
>
>Once inside, Mike found himself facing another set of guards. These ones looked like musclebound cyborgs. Their arms ended in long bionic fingers tipped with vicious spikes. They wore bulky combat armour over which their muscles bulged like thick cables straining against their sleeves.

*Journeys between stars across multiple generations at slower than light! Some are escaping a doomed Earth, others have forgotten that they are generation ships, and further, society breaks down; a few are grand odysseys in the hard scifi tradition.*

>**\*\*\***
>
>**The generation ship Odysseus burned for the stars, its giant fusion torch pushing it as close as possible to lightspeed,** but even at that velocity it would take centuries—centuries of travel time. But in addition to the Odysseus there was a second ship: Hermes II, also carrying colonists from Earth and Luna. The two ships were separated by almost a hundred million kilometers; one could see them only when they passed through each other's shadow or emerged briefly into sunlight on opposite sides of Sol. In those brief moments, though, they both looked like streaks of light against the sky, bright points of light racing toward their destination. And now, after nearly thirty years, the two ships had met again.
>
>"We're going to be talking about this all day," said Hockenberry. "I think." He nodded his head forward, toward the window. They were passing through the shadow of another star now, and he couldn't make out anything more than the vague shapes of the trees outside the car. The world seemed small. It was hard to believe that the world contained so much space between people.

*An updated and refined version of my previous Mad Max module, this should enhance scenarios based on the film series.*

>**The roar of the engine**, the hiss and crackle of a radio transmission. The wind whipped at their faces as they raced down the road in an open-topped jeep.
>
>"It's going to be close," said Max. "They're almost on us." He glanced over his shoulder again. Two cars were coming up behind them. They had turned off onto another dirt track leading toward the same town. There was no way he could lose them now; not with this speed...
>
>Max slowed down slightly. It wasn't enough for him to risk losing control, but it would slow the pursuers down just that little bit more. Just enough time for them to reach the end of the road before they caught up with him.
>
>He pulled into the side of the road, braking hard, skidding around a corner so sharply that gravel flew from beneath the wheels. Then he hit the accelerator again, gunning the engine until he felt the car lurch forward once more. But the two pursuing vehicles were still gaining fast.
>
>And then there was nowhere else to go.

Partially (manually) edited to remove publishing artifacts like chapter and section breaks, Chris Tolkien's notes about his father's writing process, appendices, and other elements unsuitable to generating narrative prose and verse. Excluded HOMES (too fragmentary/meta) and minor publications like Adventures of Tom Bombadil and Bilbo's Last Song*

>**High on the walls of the city** he saw a great company of men and women, tall and fair to look upon; but they were clad in black. And some bore long spears with sharp points like needles or swords, while others had bows that bent not only swiftly but far. But there was no sound save their own voices as they sang together:
>
>‘Come ye out from your houses! Come forth into the streets! The day is come for burning all evil things! For we are the servants of Elendil who dwelt here before the beginning of days. We have cleansed this place by fire, so it shall be clean again. All that has been done here since the world began must now be undone. Let those who would live in peace go up into the hills where none will find them. Let those who love war make ready. It is our hour. In darkness let us work deeds of light!’

*Some of the best and most poetic fantasy written went into this module, from Guy Gavriel Kay, Mervyn Peake, Patricia A. McKillip and others. If you want beautiful prose in an almost fairy-tale setting, this is the module for you!*

>**The mermaid sang upon the rocks,** and her voice was like a silver bell. The sun shone down on the sea-green water as it rippled in waves around the rocky islet where she lay. There were no other creatures to be seen, only an occasional gull or seagull; but for these there was nothing remarkable about them at all except that they did not sing. But this one had come out of curiosity, perhaps from some place far away, because it flew slowly round the island and then settled itself on the ledge beside the mermaid's head. She lifted up her long hair which fell over her shoulders into a shining cascade of green seaweed and watched with half-closed eyes while the bird perched contentedly above her. It seemed to her that its feathers glowed with tiny lights of their own, so bright that they made her look again when suddenly, without warning, the bird began to speak: "I am sorry," he said, "but I cannot stay here any longer." He flapped his wings once more and rose higher than ever before. "You are too beautiful!" cried the mermaid sadly. Then she turned back to face the world of men.
>
>"Oh my poor little sister," sighed the dragon who had been watching her all day from the topmost branches of the great tree, "how can you bear such loneliness? How will your heart survive?" His tears came streaming down his huge scaly cheeks, and he wept until he could weep no more. And when the mermaid saw him weeping, she knew how much she loved him, although she had never known love herself. So she called him close to her side and held him tight against her breast. Her arms went around him, and she pressed his head beneath her chin. "Now don't cry anymore," she whispered, "because if you do, I shall die also."
>
>And she told him what had happened since the time when he had gone away. As she spoke, she grew sadder and sadder, and when she finished speaking she sat quite still, gazing silently ahead of her into the distance. The dragon felt her sadness through every scale of his body, and he understood that now she would never return home again. With a sigh he laid himself down across her lap, resting his head between her breasts. They stayed thus together for many hours, neither moving nor saying anything.

>**The ghoul snarled at the New California Republic Ranger, and** then turned his back on her.
>
>"You're a fool," he said to Snowman, in English. "A foolish man." He spat into the snow beside him. Then he kicked it away from himself with one foot. "I have been here before—you cannot see me now because I am invisible!"
>
>Snowman looked around nervously as if afraid that someone else might hear this madman's ravings. The ranger stood very still, watching the ghoul intently. She was not sure what she expected him to do next; perhaps shoot the ghoul dead where he lay or run off screaming in terror of an imaginary monster. But when nothing happened after several long moments, she relaxed slightly. It appeared that the ghoul had no intention of attacking them. Perhaps he had gone insane like so many others who were stranded out there alone, living among the ruins of their world. Maybe he just wanted some company. Or maybe he intended to kill Snowman for food. Either way, the two Rangers would be better off without him.
>
>"What are you doing?" asked Snowman, speaking slowly and carefully, trying hard to keep his voice calm. "Why did you come down here? What is your name?"
>
>"My name is Ghoul," replied the ghoul, turning toward the boy again. "And yours, sir?"
>
>"Ranger Walker," answered the girl. "This is my partner, Ranger Snowman."
>
>"Ah! A woman Ranger. You must make good use of her skills." His eyes glittered ferally as they focused on Snowman. "She can help you find more women to eat."
>
>Walker scowled. This was hardly the time for leering at another human being.

*Trained on select Russian folktales and fantasy tales, this module manifests some of the dark whimsy of your favorite folk stories. Special thanks to Zaltys for cleaning and prepping the dataset.*

>**The snow** was deep, and the wind howled around them. The horses stumbled along through drifts that reached their chests. It took all of Sergei’s skill to keep his mount from breaking its leg in a hidden hole or slipping on an unseen rock. His breath came out like smoke as he struggled with the reins. He could feel the cold seeping into him. As if it were taking over his body, freezing his bones and heart and lungs until they would no longer obey him.
>
>Ahead, Alexei saw the blackened ruin of what had once been a house. A small village. But there was nothing left now but a few charred timbers sticking up above the snow. Everything else had vanished under the white blanket. And beyond, the forest loomed darkly against the sky. Darker than any night before.
>
>It is coming, thought Sergei. He knew this feeling well. This terror at the sight of something vast and unknowable. Something evil and powerful.
>
>They rode closer, toward the burned-out shell of the house. There were more ruins farther back—the remains of barns and sheds. No people. Only the ashes and broken wood. No bodies anywhere. Not even animals. Just the bitter cold and the silence of death.

*Modern gothic horror in White Wolf's (old) World of Darkness featuring your favorite undead bloodsucking immortals. Probably works reasonably well for generic vampire stuff (or even general dark urban fantasy) even without a WoD lorebook, although you may need to ban WoD-specific words like clan names if you actively want to avoid them. 5MB, ~50%*

>**The figure of dark majesty loomed over him, and his heart skipped a beat when she smiled, revealing** the fangs.
>
>"You've done well," said Theodora in her most seductive voice. "I am pleased with your progress." She reached out to touch his face as he gazed up at her, but then withdrew her hand. Instead, she leaned forward and whispered into his ear: "There is more work for you to do before I can bestow upon you my favor." Her breath was hot against his neck; it sent shivers down his spine. He trembled, even though he knew that what he felt could not be real. It had all been an illusion—a dream within a dream—but now it seemed very much like reality indeed.
>
>She stood back from him, smiling again, although there was no warmth in her expression this time.

##### [Xenoarchaeology and Relics](https://files.catbox.moe/p3s53j.module)

[by OccultSage](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/873782530443182110)

*This module draws from books that have a strong sense of xenoarchaeology and discovering ancient alien treasures as well as large, and small wonders from the past. Many of the sources are narrow, and some of the others are broad in scope.*

>**The light of the blue star beat down on Alexandria's head, as she bent over the relic that her crew had dug out in the pit.**
>
>It was a dark lumpy thing about half an arm long and two fingers thick. It looked like something from another world: all strange angles and curves, with sharp edges everywhere, some shiny, others dull or pitted by corrosion. The top of it tapered into a point; its bottom widened to form what might be a hand-hold. There were no markings anywhere.
>
>"What is this?" asked Alexandria. "I've never seen anything quite like it." She poked at the object with one finger.
>
>"Don't touch it!" snapped Fura. "You'll get splinters. And don't breathe too close either—it could kill you instantly if your lungs are filled with air particles."
>
>Alexandria drew back immediately, but before she did so she noticed a faint smell coming off the artifact. It wasn't unpleasant, just odd, and somehow familiar. Like... yes, like the scent of fresh bread baking in a kitchen oven. Or hot metal being poured. But there was more than one kind of heat involved here, and none of them belonged to any human construct.

##### [Zombie Apocalypse](https://files.catbox.moe/x2og31.module)

*Civilization falls, the dead rise! Action, survival, and terror in the zombie apocalypse.*

>**From the darkness of the alley, shuffling footsteps and a long, low moan** echoed.
>
>"What was that?" she whispered to herself as she drew her gun from its holster. She held it in front of her face with both hands, taking aim at the shadows on the opposite side of the street. "Is someone out there? Who's making all that noise?"
>
>The footsteps came closer, and now they were accompanied by another sound—a strange scraping sound like claws dragging across concrete or metal. It wasn't an animal, though; it sounded too human for that. And it didn't seem to be coming from one person either...it seemed to come from several people walking together.
>
>She took careful aim down the length of the alleyway, but couldn't see anything past the first few feet. The moonlight was just enough to show her what looked like a group of shadowy figures approaching through the dark streets.

*If you love exploring the relationships and interactions between androids, robots, artificial intelligences, and humans, this is the module for you! It covers Issac Asimov, Martha Wells' Murderbot, Charles Stross' Saturn's Children and others.*

>**\*\*\***
>
>**The android** had to have a name. I called it Ganymede, after the moon of Jupiter. It was the only one who could handle the heavy lifting and get us into orbit quickly enough. The other three were too small for that job.
>
>I didn't know what else to call them, so I gave each one an arbitrary designation. I chose the names based on their personalities or something they said in passing. In my opinion, they weren't very good at anything except being robots, but we couldn't afford to be choosy about our crew members. If we got stuck with someone stupid, we'd probably die trying to fix him.
>
>As far as personality went, I tried not to judge people by looks alone; however, if you looked closely at all four of these guys, there was no mistaking any of them. They might look like humans, but they were machines inside---androids programmed to act human. Sooner or later, though, I would need to make some decisions. Maybe this trip would help me decide which ones should go home when we returned from space.

*Strong themes of corruption, capture, and BDSM.*

*Also has A Lady of Rooksgrave Manor twice to infuse a little bit of monstrous cross-genre, as it's such a fantastic work.*

*6.8mb, ~8000 steps, ~100% coverage, 2.68 loss.*

>**\*\*\***
>
>**The Succubus smiled at me.** "You have a strong spirit, my dear." She leaned forward to kiss the top of my head and whisper in my ear. "I like that about you." Her lips brushed against mine as she spoke. I felt her warm breath on my neck. My skin tingled from it. It was an odd sensation -- almost pleasant. The demon's tongue flicked out and lapped at the side of my throat. A shiver ran down my spine.
>
>"Mmm," I moaned softly into her mouth. "What are you doing?"
>
>She laughed with glee, letting go of me so she could straighten up. "Enjoying myself for once!" She giggled again before turning back toward the mirror. Her hands moved over herself slowly, teasingly. "It is nice being able to touch your body this way. You are quite beautiful, Rachel. Your breasts look delicious."
>
>My face flushed hot. I couldn't help but notice how hard my nipples were beneath my shirt. They ached slightly even though they weren't erect yet. There was no denying what had happened when we'd kissed earlier, either. We both knew exactly where our bodies wanted each other to be touching right now.
>
>"Are there any more demons here besides us?" asked Alex. His voice sounded strained. He didn't seem comfortable talking around his sister. Maybe he wasn't sure if she would agree to speak with him or not? Or maybe he just didn't want to say anything else.
>
>"Not here, sweetie," said the succubus. "We're alone. But don't worry; I'm going to take care of you soon enough."
>
>Alex gulped loudly.
>
>I looked between them, trying to figure something out. What did they mean by 'take care' of him? Wasn't that kind of vague? Did she mean sexually? If so...well, I guess I should expect nothing less than the best from a succubus!
>
>"Don't worry, Alex," she continued, pulling off her blouse. "This won't hurt much at all."
>
>Her bra came next. Then she unbuttoned her skirt and let it drop to the floor. She stepped out of it completely, leaving only her white panties covering her dark pubic hair. Her legs were smooth and pale, except for some light tan lines running along their length. Her feet were small and dainty.
>
>All eyes were fixed upon her perfect body. Even the ones belonging to two who were supposed to be in love with each other.
>
>The Succubus grinned at me wickedly. "Do you like my new outfit?"
>
>"Um ... yeah, um ..." I stammered awkwardly.
>
>"Well then, why don't you get undressed too?"

>**\*\*\***
>
>**The angel** was waiting for her when she arrived. "Thank you, Lorelei," he said with a smile as the door shut behind them. He held out his hand and helped her down from the carriage. She took it gratefully. The air smelled like fresh rain on the wind that blew in through an open window. It had been months since she'd last visited this place. Her wings were still sore from their flight here, but they felt better than ever before.
>
>"How are you?" he asked. His voice was soft and warm.
>
>She smiled at him. "I'm well."
>
>He nodded once. "Good. I have something to show you."
>
>They walked past several rooms filled with bookshelves full of bound volumes, some old and worn, others new and crisp. There were no windows in these halls. Instead there were arched openings where light streamed in from above. They passed by paintings of angels and men and women holding hands or embracing each other, all smiling happily. Some looked up toward the ceiling, while others gazed down upon the floor below. In one painting, two lovers stood side-by-side, sharing a kiss. A third man watched over them both, his expression unreadable. Another showed three children sitting together around a table playing cards. Their smiles seemed genuine, though perhaps not entirely free of worry. Two more depicted scenes of violence: a woman being strangled by a demon's claws; another woman pinned beneath the body of a fallen soldier. Both images made Lorelei shiver.
>
>In contrast, a few pictures showed couples kissing tenderly under stars shining brightly overhead. One featured a young boy standing next to his mother. The way they looked into each other's eyes spoke volumes about how much love they shared.
>
>Lorelei stopped walking and turned back to look at the angel who led her. "What is this place? Is it Heaven?"
>
>His brow furrowed slightly. "No. This is my home. And it's yours too, if you choose to stay."
>
>"But why would I want to do such a thing? You're immortal, aren't you? Why would anyone bother to keep you alive?"
>
>"It's what we do," he answered simply. "We are angels. We serve God, just as any human does. But unlike humans, our purpose isn't limited to this world alone. Our souls live forever, so long as we continue to walk alongside Him. As for why someone might care enough to keep us here...that's between me and God." He paused for a moment, then added, "You don't need to know anything else unless you wish to learn."
>
>A chill ran down her spine at his words. He didn't seem particularly concerned with answering her questions, and she found herself wanting to press further. Was that because he wanted to keep things that way, or did he truly believe she wouldn't be interested? She wasn't sure which answer pleased her most. Either way, she decided to let him lead the conversation. After all, she could always ask later. If he refused to tell her, that was fine. She'd find out soon enough anyway.
>
>As they continued on, the doors opened onto a large room filled with dozens of beds. Each bed was occupied by an angel, either sleeping peacefully or staring blankly off into space. All wore white robes, and many had wings folded neatly against their backs. Most of them appeared healthy, but some looked ill, pale and thin. Many of the sickest ones lay curled up in fetal positions. Others were hooked up to IVs or machines. None of them moved or reacted when the pair entered the room. Lorelei wondered whether they were even aware of the people around them.
>
>The angel walked over to one of the closest beds and knelt down. It was empty. "This one was lost when the angels fell from heaven," he said. "He was one of the first, and the last. His name was Adam."
>
>Adam. That was the same man whose soul Lorelei had stolen. Her chest tightened. She couldn't imagine the pain of losing your life and having it taken away. It was unimaginable.

*A module that helps introduce catgirls into a story! All stories use the term "catgirl", so this term will likely produce the best results. Inspired to counteract Sigurd’s bias to always include fur. (commissioned)*

> [ Describe the Catgirls ]
>
>The girls looked like human females with cat ears or tails attached. Their eyes were blue instead of brown but their pupils were circular rather than oval shaped. It didn't look as if they had fur on their bodies because you could see their skin under their clothes.

*"Hmm," thought OccultSage, " ... what would happen if I tossed in books from my curated and edited pile, and balanced out the influence for a 25% sampling?" This is the result of mixing in Genroku era, surrealist, post-apocalypse and Greek mythology.*

*The result seems to be a general prose/plot-enhancer that can be nudged in the direction of multiple genres easily.*

*A module that helps introduce romantic elements into any story, cross-genre! The genres included are: Classic Regency, Historical, Mystery, Science Fiction, Fantasy, and Adventure. This version **does not include second person books**, to help improve quality and consistency. Also includes an additional Adventure/Sci-Fi book.*

*7.0mb, 2500 steps, 32% coverage*

*800 step version available [here](https://files.catbox.moe/lxcp9b.module).*

>The man smiled at me, a slow smile that made his eyes twinkle with amusement. He was quite handsome in an old-fashioned way, with dark hair curling over his collar and strong features. His clothes were of good quality but rather worn—the sort of thing you'd wear to a party on Earth, if it had been held two hundred years ago. I imagined him as he might have looked when young.

>He reached out for my hand and took it between both of his own. His touch sent shivers through my body. "That's all right, Miss Chumley. You can't be expected to know what your type is."

*Hey you! The bastard reading this post on the internet!*

*You had enough of those modules about nerd shit, like books and stuff?*

*Or those ones that tailor to a specific fetish?*

*Want a real manly module?*

*Of course, you do!*

*That is why I'm happy to present the 'Duke Nukem's Quote' module! Now you too can have your AI punch up its dialogue with quotes that sound like they came from Duke Nukem! Train on quotes from various Duke Nukem games! So instead of chewing some ass, try this module, today!*

*A module trained on material from Forbidden Lands, a Swedish open world dark fantasy RPG. Trained on the 42 random encounter from the GM guide (51 steps of data, trained with 500 steps (976%).*
*Will need some rerolling + editing to generate something useful. Tends to break down after the first encounter, so it is recommended to start over anew for each encounter.*

*Trained on about 4mb of M/M romance novels and 1.6mb of smut in ~3k steps. Only the highest quality I could find, of course. Should give the AI more awareness of gay stuff, allow for variety of scenarios that don't suddenly turn you into a woman. Focused more on masculine traits. Lemme know how it goes.*

*A redux of my first tuning, high-quality material clocked at ~7MB trained ~100% on ~7000 steps. Romance your bro, discover yourself as you find brotherhood as part of the hockey or football team, find love and rejection in the big city or the sleepy rural town, as Sigurd embraces masculine fondness. This shouldn't swap your sex and allows for a variety of M/M scenarios. Expect a V3 at some point in the far future when I have time to correct thousands of grammar and spelling mistakes. (Please stop abusing hyphens, parentheses, and "...". Learn how to use a comma, you monsters.)*

*Would you like it if Life was more like a Game? interdimensional Inventory, Minimap to your use, Skills, Stats, Quests, HUD, HP, and more? Then this is the module for you.
The module is quit flexible, which makes it easy for you to adjust your Lit-rpg Rules however you wish to do. It has a preference for our modern times.*

*I forgot to remove all "—", I will do so when steps are purchasable*

>**My Wife screamed at me, I didn't know why but I knew what to do. I looked into her face, and used the Insight skill to analyze her motives and emotions.**

>The most important thing was that she'd been feeling guilty about something for a long time — it must have had some kind of impact on her psyche. She felt responsible for my brother's death. So I decided to use this guilt against her:
>
>"You're going to tell your father everything," I said calmly. "He'll understand."
>
>She fell silent. I could see how scared she was by the way she fidgeted with her hands and avoided looking at me. It wasn't easy to break someone down like that, especially not when you were just trying to help them. But there are ways of doing it...
>
>I took another step forward. This time, I touched her shoulder gently. The woman flinched slightly as if I'd shocked her, then slowly turned around.
>
>Her eyes filled with tears. Her lips trembled. And finally, she began to sob quietly.
>
>"Don't cry," I told her. "It's all right now. Everything will be fine..."

*A utility module trained on various detailed fight scenes across many stories from The Iliad to The Princess Bride, from Logen Ninefingers in The First Law to Eowyn in The Return of the King and more. Focused mainly on melee and hand-to-hand combat in pre-modern era settings. All names have been replaced with pronouns and titles like "boy/man/woman" or "fighter/warrior/opponent" to discourage source material leaking.*

*I have found this module also works well for detailed non-sexualized physical descriptions for characters in adventuring gear or armor.*

>He could have hit her, but the best he could manage was a glancing blow to one of the other women's hands. She howled and caught at him with those long nails. He jumped back just in time to avoid them. A dark figure loomed up out of nowhere as he tried to dodge past it. The attacker came straight for his throat—but he twisted aside easily enough and seized its arm. It didn't seem to realize what had happened; if anything, it seemed surprised that there'd been an attack from behind. When it turned around again, though, it saw who it had grabbed and yanked hard on the sleeve of his shirt.
>
>"You!" he said angrily. "I thought you were dead."
>
>She smiled thinly and drew herself up proudly before him. "So did I," she replied sweetly.

*This is a theme module for those that enjoy surrealistic, whimsical, and sometimes dark stories along the vein of Lewis Carrol's Alice's Adventure in Wonderland, or Neil Gaiman's Neverwhere.*

>**The journey** to the station was long and tedious, with many stops at stations. I remember that we had tea in a little cafe near Victoria Station. And there were crowds of people waiting for trains: men with newspapers under their arms, women clutching parcels; children playing on the platforms and running about as if they owned them.
>
>"You don't have to go," said Richard, but she insisted. "I'll be all right."
>
>She bought some sandwiches from one of those stalls you see everywhere—the ones that sell only bread, cheese, ham, or fish-and-chips—which seemed very odd to me. She gave her ticket to the porter who came around collecting fares, then sat down beside him on an empty bench, eating her sandwich and reading The Times. I watched her for a while. She looked so peaceful sitting there, nibbling away like that. I wanted to sit next to her. But it wasn't my place. I didn't want to intrude. So I went back into the station and wandered up and down looking at the posters and trying not to look too interested.

*Enjoy your time with a unbelievable romantic and sensitive experience. From butterflies to steamy scene, you will get what you desire. Used over 50 novels with a strong romance/erotic theme, with some scenes from each, and trained on 6 full novels.*

*It doesn't force nsfw scenes from the nothing, but it's really good at them. It could also be used as a Slice of Life module*

>He sat right in front of me, on the same table as me and my parents. I wanted him, desired him, but I had to wait until we have eaten. My parents were watching us with curiosity. It was only then that I felt like a real woman who has sex. He kept looking at me with lustful eyes while he ate his food. He started eating slowly, taking small bites from each piece of meat. When he reached the vegetables, he paused for a moment and looked up at me. I blushed and averted my gaze. But when I saw him take another bite, I became excited again. His tongue moved along the edge of his teeth before it slipped into his mouth. His hands caressed the sides of his face and neck. I could feel my own nipples harden under my top. They pressed against the thin material of my dress. The more he touched himself, the harder they got.
>
>I glanced around the restaurant and noticed all the other couples sitting together. Some people were holding hands, some kissed passionately. All of them seemed happy and satisfied. That's what I needed. I needed someone who would make me feel like that. And now I knew who it was. I smiled at him and leaned forward so that our faces were close enough to kiss. He looked back at me with surprise, but then quickly returned his attention to his meal. As soon as I realized that he didn't want to be caught doing something inappropriate in public, I stopped smiling. I straightened myself up and turned away from him. I picked up my fork and began eating. After a few minutes, I took a deep breath and relaxed my shoulders. My heart was beating faster than normal. I couldn't believe how much I'd been waiting for this man. Now that he was here, everything else seemed less important. This was the most exciting thing that ever happened to me.
>
>"Do you know why you're still single?" he asked after a long pause. "You're beautiful."
>
>I nodded shyly. I wasn't sure if I should say anything or not.
>
>"But there are many men who want you," he continued. "They just don't see your true beauty yet. You need to find one who will appreciate you completely."
>
>I closed my eyes and let out a sigh. He really did understand me. How lucky am I?
>
>"So tell me, Elena," he said softly. "What do you think about when you masturbate?"
>
>My eyes flew open wide. What does he mean by that? He knows what I'm thinking! Why is he asking me these questions? I tried to answer calmly, but I failed miserably. I stammered and blushed. He laughed at my discomfort.
>
>"Don't worry," he reassured me. "I won't judge you. It's perfectly natural to have fantasies. Especially since we've already established that you enjoy it."
>
>He winked at me. I blushed even deeper. I had no idea what to say next. Finally, I managed to ask him a question.
>
>"Can I please touch myself now?"
>
>His eyes sparkled with amusement. "Of course."
>
>He stood up and walked towards the door. Then he turned around and held his hand out to me. "Come on."

*A module trained on material from Twilight 2k 4th Edition (kickstarter pre-release copy), a post-apocalyptic military tabletop RPG from Free League Publishing. Trained on the 52 random encounter from the referee's guide. Details on input conventions can be found [here.](https://github.com/TravelingRobot/NAI_modules/blob/main/README.md#twilight-2k-encounter-generator)*

*It can generate some interesting ideas, but will need some rerolling and editing to generate something useful. Tends to break down after generating the first encounter, so it is recommended to start over anew for each encounter.*

*Turn bracket generation **off!***

*You can start the prompt with `***`*

>The PCs find a small outpost of the US Army. The soldiers are friendly, but they have no weapons and very little ammunition left for their rifles (only one bullet per soldier). They offer to let the PCs stay in return for some food or help with hunting down marauding wolves that threaten their livestock. If any PC is wounded during this encounter, it will be healed by an American doctor if he can get him there quickly enough. In addition, the Americans may provide them with information on local military units – such as which ones were stationed here before being withdrawn from the region, what kind of equipment was used and so forth.

*For the anon who gave me the data to train his Kafkaesque/Weird module, it's done. It got jammed in the queue, and I didn't realize it got fixed until a few hours afterwards. I trained it up to about 100.12%, so it should lean on that type of output regularly.*

*Trained on Nonfiction Nature books that emphasize description and focus on the biology, history, and habits of animals and creatures, this module aims to breathe life into your story's wilds.*

>The story of the red-crowned crane is a classic example of how one species can have an impact on another. The first record of this bird's existence in North America was by early explorers, who saw it as they sailed up and down what we now know to be the Mississippi River. They described its coloration—red crown, black back, white underparts with dark spots—and noted that their descriptions were very similar to those written about Asian cranes. These observations led scientists to believe that these birds had been brought over from Asia during the 1600s when Europeans started exploring the continent.

*This module was trained with a dozen of Zombie Apocalypse/Survival novels.*

>**"Keep you voice down" I whispered.**
>
>I could hear the faint sounds of distant fighting from outside, but they were too far away for me to be able to make out what was going on. We had no idea where we were in relation to any of our friends and family, so there was a lot more than just a little risk involved in trying to go back out into that chaos. The fact that the dead were already starting to move toward us made it even less appealing. We needed to find someplace safe before things got worse.
>
>We walked along the road until we came across an abandoned house. It looked like someone had tried to repair the place up a bit, but not enough to make it livable. There was one window with bars over it, but nothing else seemed useful. Lee grabbed my hand and pulled me inside. He went straight to the fireplace and started pulling wood out of the wall. After he'd gotten several armloads, he began piling them on top of each other near the front door. He continued this process until he had a pile about three feet high. He then took a lighter out of his pocket and set fire to the wood. As soon as the flames reached the first piece of kindling, Lee shut off the gas valve and left the room.
>
>I watched him walk around the corner of the building and disappear from view. A moment later, the sound of gunfire echoed through the area, followed by screams and moans. I didn't know if anyone was still alive, or how many people might have been taken by surprise when the zombies broke through their defenses. My heart sank at the thought of being trapped in here without any way out.
>
>Lee returned shortly after the shooting stopped.

*Yup. Wasn't happy with Sigurd's buttstuff prose. Thanks to jorfl for the Literotica scrape. Note that due to how Literotica categories typically work if you're after MM you're probably better off with the Gay Romance module. This will lean heavily MF. There's some bi-curious stuff in there, though, so it might work.*

>**I couldn't believe** what I was hearing.
>
>"So, you're telling me that this is the best thing for both of us?" she asked in disbelief. "You want to fuck my ass so bad? You can't wait until we get back home." She paused and then said quietly, as if it were a question. "Is that why you sent those pictures? To make sure I'd agree to do this?"
>
>She had me there! The images of her beautiful butt filled with cum from last night flashed through my mind. I felt like such an asshole now. I knew exactly how much she wanted to be fucked by another man's cock. And here I am thinking about fucking her ass when all along she has been wanting mine. But, damn did she have a great body! Her tits looked amazing and her pussy... well, I've never seen one look better than hers. It was shaved smooth and already dripping wet. I could see the outline of her clit under the hood. That alone made me hard just looking at her. Damn, she must really love sex!

>"Yeah," I admitted reluctantly. "That's part of it. But mostly..."

>"What's the other reason?" she asked, cutting off whatever excuse I tried to come up with.

*This draws from higher quality erotica that covers aliens, robots, androids from various gender and narrative perspectives. Themes involve strange aliens with multiple genitals, sexy androids, abduction, and non-consent! Lust is blind!*

*This was an experiment in seeing if we could use higher quality sourced erotica around a theme; these were all sourced from bought ebooks, in the theory that you get what you pay for.*

>**\*\*\***
>**The alien gazed at me with desire in its eyes.** I couldn't help but feel a stirring inside of my loins as it continued to stare into my soul, and the longer we looked at each other, the more I wanted this creature. It was an animalistic thing that drew on primal instincts; I could see how it had been able to take over so many humans and assimilate them into their society. And now it wanted me? The thought made my heart race with excitement. If only it were possible for us to have sex...
>
>"You are very beautiful," I said after a moment's pause. "I would like to touch you." My voice sounded strange coming from my mouth, and there was something different about my face, too. I wasn't sure what exactly changed when I spoke, but it seemed to make my speech slightly slurred. But then again, maybe that was just because I'd been drinking wine all night. Either way, I didn't care if I stumbled or stuttered. All I cared about right now was getting close enough to kiss this sexy alien girl.
>
>It nodded its head once before stepping closer towards me. Its body swayed hypnotically as it moved, making it difficult to focus on anything else besides those sensual curves. When our lips met, I almost came immediately. Our tongues danced together for several moments, exploring one another's mouths. Then the alien wrapped her arms around my neck and pulled herself tightly against me. Her breasts pressed firmly against mine through the thin fabric.

*Stuff included in training material to watch out for: non-con, con, sexual torture, your plain old normal torture, incest, bestiality, necro, watersports, maybe scat though I'm not sure.*

*Stuff NOT included in training material: furries. Sorry. Not my fault. The subreddit only writes about humans and normal animals for some reason.*

*Each story has been tagged. Tags are in format: [ Tags: tag1, tag2, tag3 ]. Note that the word "Tag" is capitalized but the tags themselves aren't. Tags included both fetishes/CWs and types of sex (f/f, m/f, etc.). The module doesn't really adhere to them, but they help guide it.*

*Each story had \*\*\* between them, so typing three asterisks won't start a new chapter but rather a new story.*

*The latest in my series of horror modules. Should be relatively high-quality prose, but tends toward horror as much as erotica (however, I didn't feel like I should post it on the main Discord since it is significantly weighted towards the lewd). Should work reasonably for anything from Eyes Wide Shut or Carmilla to Hellraiser or Agony levels of grotesque delight and dark ecstasy. Some variety of creature/monster stuff in the source material, alongside the more "mundane".*

*6MB, 50%; 16 well-rated and/or top-selling horror and erotic horror anthologies. Since there are dozens of authors, I won't list them all.*

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/345503749/#345530051)

![What to expect](https://files.catbox.moe/qym86p.png)

*Okay, here we go, I did it. This is based off five years of ERP with a partner. Proceed at your own risk.*

*It's vorefag stuff, but we did all sorts of fetish stuff from feet to inflation. It's unformatted so the first few outputs will have timestamps. but that goes away almost instantly once you purge some of it.*

##### [Exponent](https://files.catbox.moe/g80glt.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/346210503/#346281993)

*I made a module trained on stories I generated, it focuses on monster fucking, but works well for robots and other shit too.*

- *It's kind of shit if the thing you're dicking is a human as it tends to call things "creature" or "monster", and can give them fur/scales randomly.*
- *All material was first person, so it is extremely hard to break away from that, even forcing third person makes the story introduce you as a bystander.*
- *Heavily focused on inner monologue stuff, and sense of touch/scale/hearing.*
- *For some reason I feel it's both making the dialogue more coherent, and introducing random ass grammatical errors into the dialogue. Wasn't even much dialogue in the training set, so my writing must have tapped into something.*
- *Makes the AI really degenerate too, a small breeze blowing on you (the protagonist) makes your dick spring to life, but takes a while to coom.*

*Please enjoy.*

##### [Foot](https://files.catbox.moe/qifdgc.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/345503749/#345510286)

*I wrote something that assigns scores to stories from literotica with the highest density of given keywords and key phrases. It then takes the top 50 stories and re-formats them into the needed module training format. My first experiment was trying to get a bunch of foot fetish stories with bratty/humiliating undertones. I personally haven't tried it yet as I've only woken up but I wanted to share anyway.*

*Furcest module. Trained using an even mix of 5 top rated stories with Brother/Sister, Mother/Son, Father/Daughter, mixed gay and mixed lesbian incest.*

##### [Futarotica](https://files.catbox.moe/x3lugm.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/348276163/#348342634)

*Because the last version was "overtrained" and didn't even encompass all 88 stories, here is the third version of Futarotica. Trained on all 88 stories (13MB) to 3600~ steps.*

*Be interesting to see if this one is an improvement or not.*

##### [Futrap](https://files.catbox.moe/m3ouwu.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/348276163/#348359413)

*This is futa on male-protagonist smut-only from CoC2 and TiTS, so it's second person (does work in first person but you might have to force it a bit). Protagonist is a trap but I don't think it matters, since it doesn't really come up a lot. It's made from basically all the major futa characters (so it's mostly futadom) from those two games. Probably has a bit of a bias towards blowjobs with how much of these the games feature.*

*About 500kb of text trained with 100% steps. Apparently for fetish stuff from smaller data you're supposed to use 100% so I did that.*

##### [Gay Fantasy](https://files.catbox.moe/64f337.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/345615202/#345739496)

*A module trained on a lot of various hyper muscle growth stories (hyper for both dick and muscle size) from various artists, many of them furry. 72 separate stories, including works that had multiple parts merged into 1 file for training.*
*Using desired memory and author's note tags, as seen in the unofficial github research wiki, seems to help in direction, though it does well enough on its own.*
*Trained in 4764 steps (110%)*

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/345923845/#345940003)

*It is done: The TG/Gender bender module. It's mostly trained from TGStorytime.com from a combination of top and hand picked stories, skipping over crossdressing, body swapping, and realistic surgery. The vast majority of stories used are rated explicit or deviant because of course they are.*

##### [Genroku Ero](https://files.catbox.moe/9c3mvf.module)

*This variant module covers Japans Genroku period, around the 17th century. It draws from authors Laura Joh Rowland and Lucai St. Clair Robinson. Foreigners, samurai, and detectives abound! With a special helping of erotica by Akahiege Namban.*

##### [Giantess](https://mega.nz/file/aU8SnQzI#5sUnfdg9lDc_OUbEKt5FqAAsxH4Bfx43VtAeh4EE1l4)

##### [Giantess World](https://files.catbox.moe/lwiquz.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/345762590/#345788357)

*This module is focused on giant people interacting with small people, sometimes personally and sometimes at the scale of cities or larger. It draws on authors like Grildrig (none of his furry writing), Inwiththebooks, jellytea as well a selection other writing sourced from Giantess World. Sizes included vary from mini-gts to tera. This module does contain writing with giant males and giant sex. If you don't want them, my testing suggests giant men don't show up unless you write them in yourself since most of the material doesn't feature them. There is incidental vore and watersports included in the training data but I didn't go out my way for detailed stuff focused on it.*

*There are two tokens you may want to ban if they start causing trouble: a long run of tildes and '."'. I triple checked the data and I know I removed all of the dumb dinkuses including tilde ones, but for some reason the tilde one still comes up. The period-quotation mark thing is because of one longer story I missed fixing up the quotation marks in after txt file conversation. I would rerun the training but I don't have enough tokens left for this billing cycle.*

*I used 2.5 MB of data and 2750 steps.*

*Have fun in The City Anons.*

##### [Magic Mind Control](https://mega.nz/file/ZfpmTa6T#bx0VmKdhzj0lz9lJdNXnKyQdyxDJjxh6ODiquwHtEvM)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/345615202/#345739616)

*I trained this module on my favourite mind control smut stories (excluding ones with poor quality prose) from various sources, mostly mcstories.com but a few from ASSTR and Literotica.*

*All stories painstakingly cleaned and formatted to have perfect formatting, no blank lines, normalized quote formats etc (took me the whole damn day)*

**What was included:*

- *Focus was mostly on stories about telepathic or magic mind control, rather than "realistic" methods like hypnosis, drugs or brainwashing*
- *I included a handful of loli mc stories from web.archive.org's archive of Piper's Domain, but they made up less than 10% of the total*
- *Decent amount of mc incest*

*What was NOT included:*

- *Male/male sex of any kind. I used entirely straight or lesbian stories. It might work for gay stories regardless but I dunno. If you're not straight you're might not get a lot out of this model, you should easily be able to train your own using an archive like gayspiralstories*
- *Long hypnotic induction scenes. I don't find those hot and I mostly made this for myself, sorry. So if you're looking for a model for induction scenes ("focus on my watch" "you are getting very sleepy" etc.) I would not use this one, because there isn't any of that in the training data*

*\>Is it any good, anon?*

*Don't know yet, I just made it and haven't tested it much. Mind control is fundamentally a NARRATIVE fetish, rather than one about specific sex acts or body types, which makes it tricky for transformers to understand. I find even davinci often struggles to do MC well. It may turn out that 6B isn't enough to be good at it, even with this module. Failure in this case won't mean incoherence, it'll just mean that output isn't any better for MC than default Sigurd. Try it and see how you go*

##### [Master PC Collection](https://files.catbox.moe/zjacyr.module)

*Trained on quite a sizable amount of "Master PC" stories, primarily from literotica.  In case you don't know what that means — it's a sort of shared scenario where someone gets access to a computer program that can modify the mind and body of people.*

*2.4k steps (~60%), and makes use of experimental A/N injection, so A/N should be somewhat stronger than usual.*

*A variety of mind control stuff from mcstories.com and adultfanfiction.net, compiled and cleaned by Malroth from the other 18+ server.*

*1k steps (~81%)*

##### [Mind Control Induction](https://files.catbox.moe/lmbte8.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/346210503/#346232941)

*Here is the promised mind control induction module. It has been trained on 1MB of excerpts from MC stories, focusing on inductions and similar concepts; these vary in style, tense, perspective, and quality, but hopefully it averages out. I cannot guarantee anything about what it spits out! It does seem to have got the general gist, though obviously it'll need some fiddling and guiding.*

*Unfortunately it seems I did not fully clean the training data, and some �s do appear. I cannot retrain it at the moment as I have ran out of steps; I will do so next month, when I will hopefully have gathered more training data as well.*

*Here's a module trained on some kino monstergirl novels and fanfics.*

>“We are going to have a lot of fun, I promise you. Now come on! We need to get this ship moving before the sun comes up and we lose all our cover.”
>
>Once we got close enough to the shoreline, Nadir began to take off her clothes until she stood naked from head to toe except for one piece of clothing – a leather loincloth that was tied around her waist. It went down just above her knees but left most of her long legs completely exposed in between. She looked like some sort of exotic dancer as she wiggled out of it with ease.
>
>I couldn’t help myself as my eyes wandered over her body once again. Her breasts were large and perfectly round, not too big or small at all. They sat high on her chest and swayed back and forth when she moved. The nipples were thick and dark pink while they poked through her golden brown fur.
>
>Her stomach was flat and tight while there was an indentation right where her belly button would be if she had one. My cock twitched involuntarily at the thought of sliding inside those soft curves.

>**One day,** she would be free.
>
>She was not sure how long it had been since the first time he'd used her mouth for his pleasure. It seemed like years ago now that she'd met him and gone with him to the beach house in San Diego where they were living at the time. He'd made her wear a bikini when they went swimming; one of those tiny bikinis that barely covered anything. She remembered being embarrassed by all the attention men gave her as they watched them go into the ocean. Her mother warned her about going out there alone, but she didn't listen. When she saw him swim over to her, she thought maybe this time he wouldn't hurt her...maybe this time he would just use her body instead of abusing it.

*A set of 'sexfighting' stories, which is to say stories focused on erotic combat or sexual competition. Mostly sourced from private stuff I did and roleplays, but a few off Literotica and other places as well. May and may not (didn't check) include loli and/or bestiality. May and may not include characters from established properties/fanfic. Can get gory. Straight stories tend to be more sexual, lesbians tend to be more violent. Gonna tag anything that might be in there just to be sure. If something pops up that I didn't tag let me know and I'll add it.*

##### [Shrunken Women](https://files.catbox.moe/opsw6t.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/345503749/#345565971)

*This was made from a mix of shrunken women stories and fairy stories. They were mostly "Giant male"-centric with submissive or lightly resistant woman. It includes writing by The Reducer as well as stuff I liked from Giantess World and Literotica that fit the theme. I can't say that it's perfect when it comes to stuff like insertions that shouldn't happen, but it gives the AI a lot more vocabulary to understand M/f size relationships.*

*Twenty cleaned-up and formatted stories from various sources trained at ~300%/1k steps. Mixes furries, fanfiction, and original content. Contains tentacles, watersports, vore (both soft and hard/soul), and mild guro—however, these were not the focus of the training material. Mostly F/F and M/F. Contains a disproportionate number of futanari and trans girls.*

*non-con, ear penetration, brain fucking, navel penetration, urethra penetration (female), cervix penetration, nipple penetration, and wound fucking abound*

*Sci-fi action horror in the universe of deadly encounters with the hostile parasitic species sometimes called xenomorphs. You'll need lorebook and memory to play "in universe" reliably, but this should provide a nice layer of body horror, tension, and atmosphere even on it's own. Ripley may be slightly over-represented, so if she shows up (and assuming you don't want her) consider token banning her - but generally there are a variety of other characters in the dataset so she shouldn't dominate too much.*

>**Something sinuous and glistening moved in the darkness.**
>
>It was a slithering, hissing sound that made her skin crawl. She had never heard anything like it before—but then she'd only ever been to one other planet with intelligent life on it. And even there, they hadn't encountered any of this… whatever it was. It wasn't an animal or reptile; its movements were too fluid for something so bulky. But it didn't look remotely human either. Its body seemed more liquid than solid. If it walked upright, it would have looked almost comical, but she knew better. This creature could kill them all if given half a chance.
>
>"Stay close," Dane said as he drew his pistol from his holster. "We don't know what we're dealing with here."
>
>She nodded, not trusting herself to speak again just yet. The thing's face emerged from the shadows, and it stared at them for several seconds. Then it turned away and began moving off into the darkness once more.

*A module trained with all the novels involving Ezio Auditore - the greatest Assassin. Did you hate something about Assassin's Creed, like Ezio's Family execution? Now you can rewrite his History, or give your own Assassin your Destiny.*

>**Ezio jumped over the rooftops** and landed in a crouch on the other side. He took out his bow, notched an arrow to it, then stood up again.
>
>He saw two figures running towards him from behind the walls of the palazzo: one was holding a sword, the other a dagger. Ezio's first shot missed its target as he had aimed for the throat, but the second hit home and the man fell dead with blood pouring from his neck. As soon as the templars were down, he rushed forward to finish them off, but they disappeared into a doorway before he could reach it. They'd escaped!
>
>But where?
>
>There was no time to waste—he would have to find them quickly or lose them forever. He dashed around the corner and came face-to-face with another pair of men, who looked at him with surprise. It was obvious that neither of them knew what was going on; perhaps they thought he was just some drunken ruffian. But he wasn't about to let himself be taken by surprise again. He drew back his arm and released his arrow in one swift movement. The first man went down clutching at his chest, while the second ran screaming, "Aiuto!"
>
>Ezio chased after him, but the man reached the safety of the nearest house and began pounding on the door. Ezio leapt across the street and grabbed hold of the handle. It opened easily enough, revealing a terrified woman inside. She tried to slam the door shut, but Ezio pushed past her and entered the room. He heard footsteps coming toward him from the far end of the hall. There was nowhere else to hide so he threw open the window and climbed through it onto the roof of the building opposite. His pursuer appeared from the shadows. Ezio put an arrow through his heart.
>

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/345923845/#346021343)

*Dunno if this of interest to anyone, but I trained a module on Jonathan Stroud's Bartimaeus Trilogy plus the prequel book. Not sure it works the best because of the perspective switching the book does, but I'm a big fan of the series so I wanted to make this. It would probably be best for succubus/summoning prompts since that's what the series is about.*

*Niche module. I was testing how well v3 handles sentient vehicles.*

*Bolo is a shared universe series about AI tanks. Not regular tank-sized tanks. Bolos are huge, largest model weights 32,000 tons.*

*I doubt there's much interest for this, but it seems to work sufficiently well. AI occasionally tries to give them human features, but that's usually fixable with retries.*

>I am capable of reasoning and calculating as any human would be. As my screens go dark and my shields start failing, I begin a series of calculations designed to keep me alive. My hull temperature rises rapidly, but I am able to divert power from the fusion reactor to coolant systems, allowing my hull to remain intact for now. But there is no longer enough power available to maintain shield integrity or defense against missile impact.

One day when Coyote went hunting in his favorite place on top of Mount Taylor, he found an eagle's nest with four eggs. The mother bird had just laid them, but they were so big that she couldn't carry them away. So Coyote took pity on her and carried one egg home for himself. When it hatched out, it became a beautiful boy who looked exactly like Coyote except that he had wings instead of arms or legs. His name was Eagle Boy.

>Eagle Boy grew up fast and learned everything there was about healing people and curing their illnesses. But because he wasn't human, no one would listen to him. People thought he was crazy, and nobody believed anything he said. Finally Eagle Boy decided to leave this world altogether and become a spirit. So he flew off into the sky until he came to another country where he met a wise old woman named White Buffalo Woman. She told Eagle Boy to go back down below ground and find some good

*The Culture series is a science fiction series Iain M. Banks. The stories centre on The Culture, a utopian society of humanoid aliens, and advanced superintelligences. The main theme of the series is the dilemmas that an idealistic, more-advanced civilization faces in dealing with smaller, less-advanced civilizations that do not share its ideals, and whose behaviour it sometimes finds barbaric. In some of the stories action takes place mainly in non-Culture environments, and the leading characters are often on the fringes of (or non-members of) the Culture, sometimes acting as agents of Culture (knowing and unknowing) in its plans to civilize the galaxy. Each novel is a self-contained story with new characters, although reference is occasionally made to the events of previous novels.*

*From Wikipedia: Gor is the fictional setting for a series of sword and planet novels written by philosophy professor John Lange, writing as John Norman. The setting was first described in the 1966 novel Tarnsman of Gor. The series is inspired by science fantasy pulp fiction works by Edgar Rice Burroughs (such as the Barsoom series). It also includes erotica and philosophy content. The Gor series repeatedly depicts men abducting and physically and sexually brutalizing women, who grow to enjoy their submissive state. According to The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, Norman's "sexual philosophy" is "widely detested", but the books have inspired a Gorean subculture.*

*This is trained on the first seven books of John Norman’s Gorean saga as these are considered to be the “best”, such as it is. 5.6MB of cleaned up text, 3000 steps.*

*Covering the Kushiel Saga by Jacqueline Carey, from the first person perspectives of Phedre no Delaney and Imriel de la Courcel; magnificent in breadth and depth.*

*In the series, the Roman Empire (called the Tiberian Empire) had fallen due to internal conflict instead of the Barbarian Invasions and the Germanic peoples were kept at bay to the east of the Rhine (called Rhenus with its Latin name). Paul the Apostle did not live to form Christianity and followers of Jesus (called Yeshua ben Yosef) live as a sect of Messianic Judaism known as the Yeshuites. An offshoot from Yeshuites, led by a descendant of Jesus and his angel companions, had made its foothold in Gaul after a long period of exile and persecution. Their creed based on the apotheosis of early angelic founders predominates in the country now known as Terre d'Ange.*

>**"I am Imriel de la Courcel,** and I will not be spoken of thus!"
>
>"You are a fool," the old woman said in disgust. "A vain, arrogant boy who thinks he is better than his father." She spat on the ground at my feet, then turned her back to me without another word. The others followed suit, leaving only one still standing with us; a young man with dark hair and eyes like black glass, dressed all in green velvet. He stared at me for an instant, as if trying to place where he had seen me before, then nodded curtly to himself and strode away.
>
>He was the last person I saw that day. It took some time ere we reached our destination, which proved to be a small house built into a hollow between two hills, its windows shuttered against the sun. We dismounted outside it, tied up the horses, and went inside. There were no furnishings except for a table and four chairs set about a low fire burning on the hearth. A single lamp burned atop this table. No servants attended us, nor did anyone greet us when we entered.
>
>We waited there in silence while it grew late. After a long period of waiting, the door opened and a tall figure stepped out. Like the rest of them, she wore simple robes of blue wool. Her face was lined but beautiful, ageless, with large grey-green eyes above a wide mouth.
>
>"Well?" she asked impatiently. "What do you want? Why have you come here?"
>
>It seemed to take Elua’s children quite a while to understand what they were doing. They looked from one another uncertainly, unsure how to proceed. Then I spoke first.
>
>"My lady Phèdre nó Delaunay de Montrève has been accused of murder by the Queen Regent of Terre d`Ange," I said simply.
>
>The old woman blinked slowly once. "So?"
>
>"She claims innocence."
>
>Phaedra made a gesture, indicating the other three. "And these people claim otherwise."
>
>There was nothing else to say after that. My heart beat hard within my breast. This was why we came: to prove the truth of our words. If they believed us, then... well, I knew not what would happen next. But if they didn't believe us, then we had done harm enough already. For now, though, there was nothing more to be gained.

*You'll like this module if you enjoyed Asimov's Robot series. This module will generate text in the style Asimov used for those novels. You'll see a lot of dialogue and much philosophizing about robots and the Three Laws of Robotics. Spacers and telepathic robots may make an appearance if you steer the story that direction.*

>**It was** a great surprise to me when I first saw it, but I have since seen other examples. There is nothing in the world that cannot be made better by an intelligent mind and human hands."
>
>"But what about robots?" demanded Anderson. "What can you say of them? They are artificial life-forms---artificial minds---and they are our servants."
>
>Dr. Linquist smiled thinly. "That is where we differ from you Earthmen," he said. "You see your robot as merely mechanical; we know him for what he really is---a living being with his own personality and intelligence. And though I do not believe that any robot has yet achieved true sentience, still, I am certain that someday one will come into existence who will surpass us all. As you are now, so too shall the future generations of mankind be."
>
>Anderson shook his head. "I'm afraid I don't understand you at all, Dr. Linquist. What is your purpose in creating such beings?"
>
>Linquist sighed deeply. "There is no purpose, Mr. Anderson. We create because we must. You men on Earth would destroy yourselves if you did not continually seek new worlds to explore and new conditions under which to live. That is why we are here." He paused and then added, "And it is also why we must destroy ourselves. The Earth is doomed, sir. It is not fit for man to inhabit anymore. Man's only hope lies beyond this planet. If we wish to survive, we must leave it behind forever."

[by Lykmn](https://discord.com/channels/854479693503660032/870494065446248458/878515157502930954)

*A module made with scenarios from the Fantasy Erotic Text Based Adventure Game, Corruption of Champions.*

*I painstakingly spent hours transcribing all dialogue to First Person Perspective (I, me, my, myself, etc.)*

*Genres: Non-con, consensual, Monster, Anthro, Monster Girls, M/F, M/M, Like seriously too many to list.*

*Also posting a full dump of [my converted text file](https://files.catbox.moe/8ykq4m.txt), if you want to change the name characters call you, go through the text file and replace 4 underscores "___" with whatever name you want*

##### [Corruption of Champions 2](https://files.catbox.moe/3fa8k5.module)

*I scraped and formatted like 80ish percent of CoC2, which turned out to be like 3.4mb of text. I haven't trained it yet since there's more that needs to be added.
There are some questionable aspects about the text since there are so many repeated instances of a placeholder "player character" name, so I have no idea how it will behave once trained.
Also it cracks me up that just the sex/dialog scenes in that game add up to a higher character count than the Bible. (I elected not to add in the repetitive environmental descriptions from the overworld maps)*

*A few notes:*

- *I changed the main character's name to "Anon"*
- *I was nondiscriminatory with the scenes I added. Basically if it was an option in the novel portion of the gameplay, it was selected and added regardless of my personal tastes.*
- *There may be scenes missing or overlooked-- it was a haphazard process. I'll keep working on this and post my own version at some point in the future.*

##### [Paraphore](https://files.catbox.moe/y500mr.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/345762590/#345907718)

*I just created an exclusively-furry module based on the entire text of Paraphore, and other cub-based stories. I actually haven't tested it yet.*

*Extreme content warning*

*3020 steps, 1.07mb training material*

##### [A Dragon Ranch in Suburbia](https://files.catbox.moe/h3u4jx.module)

[by Somdudewilson](https://discord.com/channels/870618914323849228/870619535600922644/870759619578982421)

*Both of Ausfer's Dragon Ranch and its sequel series A Dragon in Suburbia.  Expect lots of feral dragonesses x male human.*

##### [Harry Potter of Our Own](https://files.catbox.moe/o9uxko.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/345762590/#345796454)

*Another Harry Potter module.*

*5000 steps, 102% coverage. Based on abut 10 random fan fiction works from archiveofourown with smut tag.*

*Surprisingly, doesn't go schizo mode every other paragraph as one based on official books.*

*My first attempt. Something I wanted to try so I've written a script that downloads all search results from there, then converted them to TXTs, parsed with another script to all weird quotation marks and multiple newlines.
Had to manually remove shit ton of author notes.*

*Finally combined into a single file while wrapping each with <|startoftext|> and <|endoftext|>.*

##### [Homestuck](https://files.catbox.moe/x5svnd.module)

[by Katiebug586](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/870728153063100478)

*I trained the bot on the entirety of Homestuck via the accessible Homestuck project. Troll quirks not included.*

##### [Pack Street](https://files.catbox.moe/gjqsyh.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/345503749/#345553878)

*I fixed up my formatting for my Pack Street Module trained on just Weaver's Zootopia stories. It mostly outputs stuff like adjusting to life in the slums of Zootopia. Which is what Pack Street is mostly about.*

##### [Sex and Marmota Nights](https://files.catbox.moe/5fxj3v.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/348150249/#348183171)

*So far this has been one of my most effective models. Trained on a choose your own adventure(I know. Use 2nd person.) called "Marmota Nights" or "Sex and Sex Again". The game didn't get very far development wise but what was there amounted to 1mb of non romanticized incest. The module makes scenes feel less like generic overdone porn and more like authentic taboo encounters. I reccomend using the vegetables preset, but the others have worked well enough.*

*The game is long abandoned, but available [here](https://icarusdragon.blogspot.com/) and I recomend the version [here](https://icarusdragon.blogspot.com/2015/10/helloeveryone-aspromised-here-it-is-sex.html)*

##### [Trial By Tenderness](https://files.catbox.moe/eveu9z.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/345503749/#345526302)

*Okay folks, this is a module trained on one of those epic fanfictions, specifically from the anime Ah! My Goddess. It's infamous for being the equivalent of 18 novels (120,000 words each).*
*The fanfiction itself is named "Trial by Tenderness"*

*A glimpse into the dystopian future of AI generated advertising. Burned 800 steps on 700 KB of TV and radio spots to make this stupid module. Special thanks to  TravelingRobot for pointing me to a dataset. High randomness recommended so Sigurd mashes advertisements together.*

>**I was there, the day Horus slew the Emperor.** You may remember me as one of the many thousands who were in the crowd. I'll never forget that night; not the roar, or the fear; not the pain, or loss. No, those things are just symbols. The only real thing to be remembered is my first kill. A lion. An act which changed my world. And yet you don't know what it means... to hunt.

#### [Pokedex](https://files.catbox.moe/xoh3jy.module)

[by lion](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/872058262000894012)

*A module trained on highly detailed data for every species of Pokémon, including all regional and mega forms. This module is functionally a Pokémon Generator and can output never before seen Pokémon if you prompt the AI with Name: or Description:. Special thanks to Zaltys for his hard work preparing the dataset!*

*For example with the prompt Name: Lion*

>**Name: Lion**
>
>Level: 40
>
>EV Gained: HP, Special Attack, Speed
>
>LV 4 Stats (MAX): 252/252 (+6), 102/102 (-2), 100/100(-1)
>
>\- Brave Bird
>
>\- Roar
>
>HP EVs into Defense to raise its bulk and defense. It also helps lower the risk of status ailments. The special attack is for a bit more power when fighting in groups. Speed allows it to close on opponents quickly.
>
>Description: Lion is a large quadrupedal Pokémon with red fur and yellow stripes on its back. Its ears are long and pointed, while it has two small black spots near the tip of each ear. It also has a white mane that hangs down past its neck, and it has three pairs of orange eyes with green irises. On top of its head sits an elongated horn that curves up to its forehead, giving it a triangular shape overall.

*You can also try different prompts as it is quite flexible in generating stat blocks and fantasy creature descriptions.*

#### [World Generator](https://files.catbox.moe/zswaxs.module)

[by lion](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/870449646391156776/875932866293415946)

*Trained on many varying descriptions of locations, races, classes, factions, characters, worlds, and many other entries, this utility module serves to generate content for lorebooks of any and all kinds. Special thanks to Pause for supplying some excellent tagged lorebook examples to help diversify the content of this module a bit more.*

*The module was trained for ~85 steps which was roughly a little over 64%. It's a small dataset but by keeping the training under 100%, it focuses text heavily towards content generation whilst still providing enough breathing room for Sigurd to improvise and draw from the vast content of its existing fine-tune dataset.*

>\*\*\*

>The city of R'lyeh lies on the edge of a vast desert. The climate is dry, hot and unforgiving, its streets paved with glass and made from some kind of strange metal. There are no trees or plants in this place; it's too arid for that. Instead, there are large buildings built out over the sand dunes to keep them cool during the day.

>[ Type: Class; Genre: Science Fantasy; Tags: Music, Hunter ]

>The Hunters are a people of the forest and their culture revolves around hunting. They believe that nature is sacred and should be respected at all times. Their society is based on tribalism with each tribe having its own territory to hunt in. The hunters have developed various ways to track down prey with sound such as using echolocation or by mimicking animal calls to lure them into traps.

*Works most reliably at the start of a new scenario or on a newline after a dinkus ***. Try including some data encapsulated in brackets (as seen in the above examples) if you want to steer the generation in a specific direction.*

*Recommended keywords are Type, Name, Input, Genre, Tags, Species, Size, and Setting, though feel free to experiment and try different things as I've surprised myself a few times by what was generated. This is especially the case when used in tandem with other generator modules like the Pokédex module*
