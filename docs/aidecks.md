## The fuck is it?

At the end of each month, I set up an anchor for 24 hours to collect suggestions on SETTINGS. After that, I hold a 24-hour vote, and whoever wins becomes the setting for the following month.

The submission anchor appears on Sundays of each alternate week (from Theme Friday submission collection), tracking what was previously posted so you can keep track of how the deck is developing!

### What is a setting?

I'm running with "The time, place, and/or circumstances in which a narrative can take place". This means that suggestions can be anything from "World where WW2 never happened" to "Higurashi no Naku Koro ni". So long as it can be understood as a defined setting, it should be a good fit.

### Are there any requirements for the cards themselves?

Keep the prose flowing and make each card as self-contained as possible, those are my two main requests. If you're going to make a multi-entry singular card that stacks bracketed information throughout context with innumerable phrase biases, you should reconsider your idea. Keep it as simple as possible.
Aside from that, you're good as long as it passes the "this is a thing that believably exists in this setting" test.

### How abstract can we go?

You can be as abstract as you want, but I'd assume that for cards that implement things like viruses, conditions, states of being, or other less concrete ideas, you'd make additional cards that use those things. Hey, maybe you'll get lucky and other anons will like your idea so much that they'll make cards that with it anyway!
### Where will the decks be stored?

Here, silly!

### Is any of this subject to change?

Probably! This is a brand new event after all. If something isn't working, be sure to let me know.
