### [Traditional](#writers)

#### [C. S. Lewis](https://mega.nz/file/VGwygKKa#oUAumhzb2td1uEyv_qDlC1XLnz0Ali66O4_dSqvEzN0)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/371544232/#371550395)

*I've trained my CS Lewis module for Euterpe V2. Tested and seems to be working extremely well, his style comes through much more strongly than it did with Sigurd.*

*Training data is most of Lewis's fiction: Narnia books, Space Trilogy, Screwtape Letters, The Great Divorce, Til We Have Faces, Pilgim's Regress. Plus a small selection of non-fiction works: Mere Christianity, The Four Loves, The Weight of Glory.*

#### [George Orwell](https://files.catbox.moe/twyx0p.zip)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/371608780/#371627864)

*Someone suggested to do this as a module. Done.*

*ZIP file contains the module, the training data, the image, and the base for the training data I formatted. So if at some point [Euterpe V3] or [20] beaks or whatever the fuck comes out and I'm not there to retrain the modules, you'll have everything you need.*

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/371608780/#371627864)

#### [Italo Calvino](https://files.catbox.moe/otyyhe.module)

[by mark and jez](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/939922436500107314/940092199507476551)

*A module trained on several works by Italian author Italo Calvino (originally made for Sigurd, updated for Euterpe V2)*

***Tags:** literature, fiction, good prose*
***Sources:***
- Invisible Cities (trans. William Weaver) 
- Cosmicomics (trans. William Weaver) 
- If on a Winter's Night a Traveller (trans. William Weaver)

>Here was the city that I loved. Nothing could be clearer and more impressive than its ancient majesty, with high ramparts towering in every direction over paved stone roads bordered by fine wrought iron streetlamps... it took my breath away! I went toward a restaurant called The Black Diamond in Plaza del Mascaras at two o'clock sharp. When I entered, the air smelled of garlic and oil; tables were set out on an enormous marble floor under vaulted ceilings decorated with frescoes showing scenes from Roman history and classical mythologies—a huge dining room indeed! Some people passed through: well dressed ladies wearing little black hats whose creases told their owners how many times they had been removed. There sat at one table Clara Cardellini eating spinach soup and crumb cake while her husband Giannis licked butter off his knife's tip. Next to them old Jocasta Doria drank straight-from-the-jug wine as she ate meatballs followed by red pears sprinkled with cinnamon sugar. On another side of the big square, sitting at a large round table surrounded by half-dressed waiters, was the great industrialist Eusebio Astrada y Gómez drinking something made out of potatoes he'd just bought at a nearby market stall for six pesetas apiece. And then there stood Antonio Marcelino, who owned the largest shipyard on the Spanish Main. His friend Carlos Paredes sipped champagne out of glasses shaped like cherries that seemed almost too small to contain such a powerful beverage.

#### [J R. R. Tolkien](https://files.catbox.moe/4mf2um.module)

[by untouch](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/939922436500107314/940002253136334949)

*A module trained on The Silmarillion, The Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit books, for Euterpe.*

***Tags:** LOTR, Hobbit, Fantasy, Tolkien*

*Sources: The Silmarillion, The Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit books

*This is a retrain of an existing module that was considerably cleaned up, trained to one epoch. There are some odd formatting issues with quotes but the issues are considerably less than the old module.*

***Final Loss:** 2.64*

#### [P. G. Wodehouse](https://files.catbox.moe/8781qt.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/371544232/#371553491)

*PG Wodehouse Euterpe V2 module, trained to 50.14% with 4100 steps.*

*Trained on 22 full novels and collections; 608,000+ words.*

*Much Obliged, Jeeves, The Inimitable Jeeves, Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves, Right Ho Jeeves, Jeeves in the Offing, My Man Jeeves, The Man with Two Left Feet, The Girl on the Boat, Psmith in the City, Three Men and a Maid, Tales of St. Austin’s, The Adventures of Sally, The Clicking of Cuthbert, The Prince and Betty, The Gold Bat, The Coming Of Bill, The Little Nugget, Something New, Spring Fever, Mike and Psmith, Not George Washington , Love Among The Chickens*

#### [Rod Serling](https://files.catbox.moe/q2nzv7.zip)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/371608780/#371610961)

*Alright, I'm going to be retraining my modules for Euterpe over the course of the day. Here's the first one: The Rod Serling module.*

*Trained on:*

- *Stories from the Twilight Zone*
- *More Stories from the Twilight Zone*
- *New Stories from the Twilight Zone*
- *Night Gallery*
- *Night Gallery 2*

*Those were the only ones I could find easily. I think The Season To Be Wary would've fit in well as well, but I couldn't find it. Maybe that's for V2 of the module, if that will become a thing. Anyway, I decided to include all my files with the module, so you get the original ebooks I used, the original parsing in plaintext that Pandoc made, and my final edited text files that I used for the training. Maybe it's interesting for someone to see how the module was made. Note: I had an ebook that combined the three Twilight Zone books into one, so there's three ebooks in total.*

*A first shot at a module based on Middle Eastern folklore and imaginative fantasy stories with compatible settings inspired by the region's folktales and history. I opted not to include excerpts from/the entire 1001 Nights itself this time round but I will probably revisit the theme with a narrower and more “classical Arabian folklore” focus eventually. You will probably want to downbias the token “Ç” as there is a character whose name begins with this letter and who is unfortunately over-represented in this set.*

>The city was a riot of color. It was a city that never slept, with its streets full of people and the sounds of music coming from every direction: the sound of a drumbeat in one alley, the singing of an old woman somewhere else; a young girl's laughter echoing down another street, and the shouts of a crowd at some distant point. He had heard all this before on his visits to Cairo, but now he saw it through different eyes. The colors were brighter, more intense—he felt as if he could reach out and pluck them from the air and turn them into something tangible. In the distance there came the clink of metal against metal and then the faintest cry of pain. There were people everywhere: children playing in the dirt by the side of the road, beggars sleeping in doorways or sitting up against walls, women carrying baskets on their heads, men with their hands full of goods. And all the time they were laughing, shouting, talking loudly and laughing louder still when someone laughed at their joke.

>The desert was cool beneath the night sky and the air was still, so much so that there were no clouds in sight. The moon was a thin crescent and its light seemed to spill over the dunes like blood spilling from an open wound, or like a cloud of ink spilled on a cloth. I walked through the desert, with only the sound of my footsteps breaking the silence of the night to accompany me. And though I felt nothing at all, I continued walking, as if my body was driven by some instinct of self-preservation. For it was the hour of the ghouls.

>The desert wind picked up, rustling the palms and blowing sand into his eyes. He wiped them and looked down at the old woman. "You have to tell me something."
>
>"Yes," she said. "I will tell you this: a man's life is like a candle flame that flickers in the wind, but if it burns for long enough, it can burn down to the very end of the world."
>
>She fell silent again, and he waited, holding his breath, listening to the wind. He'd never had much patience. It was one of the things he disliked about himself. He needed to know now, right now, what was going on. The old woman sighed and said, "My husband's name was Rashid al-Khoury, and I loved him more than anything in the world. He was a good man, a kind man, a man who would give you his last coin if you asked for it. When we were young, he had a terrible temper, and we quarreled often. But as we grew older, it calmed down. We shared everything. And then my son was born. We named him Ali, after his father. He was beautiful, like his father, and I loved him too." She paused, and then continued, her voice barely above a whisper. "And then one day, he went out to work in the fields with my brother, and he never came back.

*Happy Lunar New Year! This was built from a list of high and low fantasy novels, modern and classical, situated in ancient China. Here you'll find narration with the distinct cadence of oriental poetry, but here, too, you might encounter a mystic wizard who knows kung fu, a magic beast, or even a heroine on her path of immortal ascension.*

*Only award-winning and classic literature, which comprise mostly low fantasy, were used. Other, more fantastical books may be added later.*

>The next morning, as the sun rose over the mountains of northern Xinan, I stood with the others in my new household. In a moment, a horseman galloped up to the gates and dismounted. The man bowed, his eyes on me. "I am Jin Wang. I have been sent by your father." He spoke the tongue of our homeland. His words were clipped and precise, without the accent of the Goryeo or the southern Han that had crept into my own speech.
>
>"I'm very sorry. Please tell him we are all well. That is, we're all alive," I added hastily, remembering the men who had ridden out to meet them.
>
>in Wang nodded curtly. "You must go quickly. Your father's soldiers have camped three leagues north of here. They will be coming soon."
>
>I stared at him, bewildered. "How could they get that far ahead of us?"

>The night was dark and starless. The moon, obscured by clouds, had not risen. He stood before the entrance of a temple on a hilltop near the river. A great bronze bell hung from a thick rope in the middle of the roof, and he watched the mist gather at its base. It had been a long day: he'd ridden to the city, then gone with the other men to see the dead body of one of their own, whose wife he had been sent to protect. He had watched as the embalmer and his assistants took the man apart, washing him, scraping off the dried blood, cleaning, cleaning, cleaning, until nothing remained but bones, which they wrapped carefully in silk. Then it was time to dress the corpse and take up his coffin, and stand beside it for three days and nights while the bells rang mournfully, summoning the faithful to pray for his soul, or whatever the soul might be called on its journey after death.

>"It is time for the seventh moon of the winter season," said the Jade Emperor. "The three brothers must choose a wife from among all those who have presented themselves to them."
>
>The princes looked at one another in consternation.
>
>"I do not understand this rule," said Zhu Cong. "We are supposed to be choosing wives, but they must first choose wives for us."
>
>"Of course," answered the Jade Emperor. "They need to know which of you is worthy and which of you should be exiled."
>
>The princes turned to look at the princesses. They were all beautiful, young, and well-born—but it was clear that some were better than others. Some had more beauty and grace than others; some were more accomplished in music or poetry or martial arts; some seemed more intelligent than others; some were simply kinder and more generous. The princely brothers did not like any of them.

>**The mermaid sang upon the rocks,** and the gulls wheeled about her in a strange and ungraspable dance. And as they circled they saw beneath her the mermaid's arms were stretched out wide upon the sea, and her hands were empty: but the palms of her hands were covered with blood.
>
>And as the gulls cried out across the ocean to each other: "What is this?" one answered: "I have seen it before—in a dream." And then another said: "It is the time when the mermaid sleeps, and dreams of her lover." And yet another: "That is why we do not eat human flesh; for we know that the spirit sleeps, and that if we kill it, its soul shall come forth again from the grave."
>
>Then one of them cried out: "We are birds of sorrowful heart, for our hearts are heavy with sadness and grief." And all the birds, wherever they flew, sang together, and the mermaid slept.

>I woke to voices outside my window and looked out through the bars. A witch was there, a woman with skin like bronze, hair as dark as an owl's feathers. I could see she wasn't alone—there were other women standing behind her, all of them looking at me with hunger in their eyes. They were young, old, tall, short; they wore peasant dresses or gowns of fine linen; some held babies in their arms while others carried baskets on their backs. They were all different races, from all over the world—but they looked like sisters.
>
>"Alessia?" the witch asked me. "Is that you?"
>
>I realized then that I must have fallen asleep, curled up in my bed, and dreamed that she'd come for me. I wanted to tell her no, but I couldn't find my voice.

*Science Fantasy is a genre that combines Science Fiction with elements of the Fantasy genre. Typically involving religion, philosophy, good vs evil, magic, science so advanced it's like magic, computerized gods, and robots. Star Wars is the most well known media franchise of the genre though Superhero fiction also tends to lap into this category.*

*This specific module mostly trained on Space Fantasy material, a Science Fantasy sub-genre. The supernatural, religion, starships, and machines are something to expect. Magic and Science tend to blur.*

*Major fandoms drawn from are Star Wars, Star Trek (select stories), Halo, Mass Effect, and 40K.*

>**Morgan's brows furrowed, and he stared** down at the book. "You're sure? She was in there?"
>
>"It's true," said the white rabbit. He glanced at Alice again. His ears were very long, so long that they brushed the ground. "There, see? They are still moving."
>
>Morgan reached out for the book, but Alice snatched it back. The rabbit made no attempt to stop her; indeed, he seemed rather to encourage her, bobbing his head as she read.
>
>"It says here: 'And now, as winter draws in on its dark wings, and the moon moves farther from the earth, we bid you good night.' I don't understand it—I think perhaps it must be a poem or something," Alice said.
>
>"No, I'm pretty sure that's just what happens when the world ends," the rabbit said. "A poem—it says 'when winter draws in'—but I don't know how winter is drawing in."
>
>"Yes, well, that might be because the book doesn't seem to make any sense," Alice said. "It's written in a sort of code. It says something about a maze, and there's all these dots and things and lines crossed out and words that aren't even spelled right. I've tried to decipher it, but there are too many letters with multiple meanings. For example, it looks like the word 'moon' has more than one meaning. See, it says 'the moon is shining bright.' And then it also says 'and the moon moves farther from the earth.' And 'night,' and 'nighttime' and 'nightmare' and 'dreaming' and 'nightmares' and 'nightmares' and...well, you can see that it gets a little confusing."
>
>The rabbit smiled. "I don't think it is meant to make sense," he said.
>
>"Well, I still don't understand it," Alice said, glancing at the clock.

>**Once upon a time**, there was a very rich man who had four sons. The younger three were selfish and lazy. They did not like to work at all. They thought their father's money would continue to fall from the sky, so they did nothing but sit in their rooms reading books and making music all day long.
>
>One day, a beggar came up to them and asked for some food.
>
>The first son said, "Why should I feed you? You are a dirty old man."
>
>The second son said, "You have no manners. Get away from here, beggar!"
>
>The third son said, "I don't care what you think of me, but if my brothers give you food, then it is as good as mine."
>
>So he gave the beggar some food too. The beggar thanked him and left.
>Then the older brother said, "Now we will see whether our father really loves us or not."
>
>And they all sat down to wait. Soon after that, the eldest brother died, and soon after that the second brother died, and soon after that the youngest brother also died, and just when the oldest son was about to die, his coffin broke open. All his gold fell out onto the ground.
>Then the richest man in the kingdom saw this and said, "Here is a strange thing! If the dead brothers did not need any food, how could the eldest son die?"

*Updated the WW1 module for Euterpe*

*Autism. Autism went into that, along with All Quiet on the Western Front by Erich Maria Remarque, A Storm of Steel by Ernst Jünger, Under Fire by Henri Barbusse , poems by Wilfred Own, Infantry Attacks by Rommel, and more.*<br>
*Basically first person past tense accounts of infantry on the western front, both historical and fictional to hopefully give an impression of the horrors of early 20th century combat and the disaffected ruined youth of that generation.*

*I'll probably eventually whip up editions for the east, Italian front, and air combat.*

>**She rode, and rode after the love of her life**, but he had already gone west. Her heart was broken and she cried for days, weeks, and months. She vowed to follow him and bring him back.
>
>The long winter months passed quickly for her. It wasn't so much the cold that bothered her as it was knowing that there would be no more joy in the warmth of his arms. There was no comfort in this cold season, only a longing for the man who stole her heart.
>
>On Christmas Day, she was awakened by the sound of hooves on the frozen ground. For a moment, she thought it was a dream—the memory of another time and place when they were together. She rose from the bed and walked softly downstairs to investigate. The horses were harnessed up to the wagon and ready to go. She had not seen the wagon in the yard since before she left Texas. He was coming home to her!
>
>"It's too early," she whispered to herself. "He will be here at midnight, or even later." She slipped out the back door and headed toward the barn. As she crossed the yard, she noticed a faint glow of light in the barn window.
>
>"Is he here?" she wondered. She drew nearer. No one answered, but she could see a lantern hanging inside the barn. She felt a little foolish sneaking into the barn, but she was so excited, she couldn't help herself. She hurried inside and found him in the loft, fast asleep. He looked so handsome and peaceful. She smiled as she saw the quilt thrown over his legs.
>
>He stirred at the sound of her voice. His eyes opened slowly. Then, with a start, he recognized her.
>
>"Oh, my God! What are you doing here?" He tried to sit up but quickly fell back onto the hay. "I am sorry, I didn't mean to wake you. But it is so good to see you again."
>
>"It's good to see you again, too," she said softly. She crawled across the loft to join him, careful not to make any noise. His body was warm under the quilt and he felt so right.
>
>"It has been too long," he said. "I have missed you."

>**The chest opened with a creak. Inside** lay an orb, carved from black crystal. The sphere was roughly the size of a soccer ball and seemed to be made of solid obsidian. I reached for it, then hesitated as the words appeared on my display:
>
>─ Skill Acquired! You have acquired "Mysteries of the Ancient Realm" through the Orb of Knowledge! This skill grants you access to additional quests, and gives you the ability to interact with certain aspects of the realm that cannot be accessed directly without its aid.
>
>A small line of text appeared below the Skill Acquired prompt:
>
>─ Title Acquired: Mystery Breaker! Title received for completing "Quest for the Orb."
>
>I had gotten titles before. Some were simple achievements like "Scribe in Training," or "Learned" (in reference to learning new skills), common titles that I had seen others earn along their way into becoming full-fledged adventurers. This one, though, was something different entirely, something new, something special...
>
>For some reason, seeing a title like this filled me with pride.
>
>The title reminded me of how far I'd come since becoming trapped in this strange world. When I first found myself here, I felt like I was fighting against my fate, but now I could see things differently. The path forward may have been unclear at first, but as time passed and more things fell into place, I began to understand that this wasn't just some random game that would end soon; I was living in another reality, a fantasy land where anything was possible. That realization made all the difference. It gave me the courage to fight back. To take control of my own destiny.

>**The alien girl with tentacles approached me, and my eyes were arrested** by the beauty of her face. She was so beautiful that I forgot to breathe. The human man standing next to me became aware of the situation and looked at me as if he had never seen me before in his life. I felt a slight shiver of embarrassment from him. He didn't know me, but he was looking at me as if I was an animal.
>
>The alien girl was smiling at me, and it felt like my heart was going to leap out of my body. It felt like a great wave was coming from her, and it washed over me with all of its power. My heart was beating faster, and I couldn't stop staring at her. She looked like she could be my own daughter, or maybe my sister. There was such a strong sense of family between us that we would have been related somehow.
>
>"Please, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Fuchi, and I am an alien from another planet," the girl said. "You must be one of those humans that I read about."
>
>"Yes. I'm a human," I replied.
>
>"I can tell that you are a very intelligent creature. Your mind is much more developed than many others," she said.
>
>"Thank you for your compliment. We don't hear them very often," I answered.
>
>She giggled, and I realized that she was talking to me like we had known each other for a long time. There was a sense of familiarity between us. Her tentacles swayed slowly back and forth, and they were trying to pull me in closer to her. As she moved them, I got the feeling that I was being pulled toward her in the same way. I wanted to hold her in my arms, but I couldn't do it. It wasn't right to do that with someone who wasn't human. I could feel her warmth through our connection. She was so warm, and I couldn't resist her pull.
>"Come with me," she said.
>
>As I followed her, I felt like I was leaving behind everyone and everything that I knew.

>**The succubus laughed and approached me with her hips swaying**. She was wearing a tight black dress that clung to her body, accentuating her hourglass figure. She had on a long silk drape that was tied around her neck but fell off one shoulder and down the opposite side of her torso. Her long hair was tied back and flowed down her back in a black waterfall. I could see the tattoo of an angel on her chest as it swam out from under her dress. "I have some news for you." The succubus spoke seductively.
>
>"That is not how we do things," I told her sternly.
>
>"You will be my toy for a year or until I am finished with you," she replied as if she knew what was going through my head. "I don't need your permission for anything."
>
>"This is unacceptable! You are not even my mistress yet!" I said angrily.
>The succubus bent over and pulled down on the front of her dress. She let it fall off her shoulders and it fell all the way to the floor. She stood up again, exposing herself completely. Her nipples were hard and her breasts jiggled with every move she made.
>
>"Are you happy?" she asked looking at me defiantly.
>
>"No, I'm not," I replied. My heart started racing as I looked at her perfect body.
>
>"Then be quiet and play with your new body," she said as she walked over to me.
>
>I felt my dick start to stir as she got closer. The succubus sat on the edge of the table and spread her legs wide. She pushed her tits together and slid her hand between them. Her fingers moved quickly as they circled her nipples. Her eyes closed and her mouth opened slightly as she moaned in pleasure.
>
>"I am so wet right now," she whispered as her hand disappeared into her pussy. She wiggled her hips as she pumped her hand furiously.
>
>She leaned forward and looked at me. "Do you want to feel this?"
>
>I nodded my head and reached out to touch her. Her skin was silky smooth and warm against my palm. When I touched her, she shivered with pleasure. I watched her lick her lips as I rubbed her pussy. She opened her thighs wider, allowing me better access.

>*The wolf man approached me, his arousal already evident, knot swelling.* He seemed to be waiting for something before he made any further moves.
>
>"I don't understand," I said. "What is it you want?"
>
>He smiled, flashing his teeth. "You have the scent of a woman on your lips, my dear. And the taste of one in your mouth." His fingers trailed over my cheek and down the side of my neck. "And the feel of another inside you, yes?" He licked at my earlobe, then bit down hard enough to draw blood. I yelped and pressed closer to him.
>
>"Yes, it's true," I said. "I've done that with someone. A man. It was wonderful."
>
>"Then you must give me what he didn't." The wolf-man leaned forward, his hand sliding from my hip to my thigh. His palm spread against my skin as his fingers curled under the hem of my dress. My breath caught as his hand slid upward until it rested right below my ass. I shivered as his fingers grazed the bare skin there. "Will you allow me to do this for you? Please?"
>
>I nodded, not trusting myself to speak.
>
>His hand slid up my leg, slipping beneath the skirt of my dress. The wolf-man's fingertips brushed against my cunt, sending little ripples through me. His other arm wrapped around my waist, pulling me tight against him. I felt his hard cock press between us, but he held me away from him.
>
>"Tell me, sweet girl, if you would like me to touch you there." He ran the tip of his finger along the seam of my pussy. "Or do you prefer that I just lick you and make you come for me?"
>
>I moaned when he pressed two fingers inside me. His thumb rubbed against my clit. "Do it," I breathed. "Lick me. Make me come."
>
>The wolf-man licked at my pussy, drawing more moans from me. I gripped at the edge of his desk, unable to hold still. The sensation was too much. Too good. His tongue moved over me, tasting and exploring. Then he shifted, his fingers sliding out of my cunt. The wolf-man took hold of my legs and spread them wide apart. My feet were trapped between us, my ankles dangling over the edge of his desk. I moaned again as his tongue slid against my clit, rubbing softly.
>
>"Tell me, my dear," he said as he continued to tease my clit with his tongue. "Have you ever had your pussy eaten before?"
>
>"No," I said.
>
>"Is that because you don't know how it's done or is it simply a matter that you haven't found someone to do it?"
>
>"It's just not something that men have done to me." I looked at him over my shoulder. His eyes gleamed with hunger and lust. "But now... I am yours. You may do whatever you please to me."
>
>The wolf-man lifted his head and looked into my eyes. "Then you may be sure that I will make you come many times tonight. For I will enjoy tasting every inch of your body, sweet girl."
>
>He returned to my pussy, licking and sucking. I could feel his saliva dripping down my thighs as he worked me with his mouth. His fingers stroked into me and out. The way he touched me caused my breath to quicken. I could barely contain the pleasure building inside me.
>
>"I need you," I gasped. "I need your cock. Give it to me. Please."
>
>The wolf-man slid off the desk, his hands closing around my hips as he turned me. He pressed me back against it, his fingers sliding beneath my dress to grasp my ass cheeks. My back arched as he bent me over the desk, his cock pressing against my wet pussy. I could smell my own sex and it filled my nostrils. The wolf-man pressed his cock against me and slid inside me. I cried out at the feeling of being filled by such a huge cock. My ass pressed against the edge of the desk.

*An update to my previous Cougar/MILF themed module, this time for Euterpe.  No major changes besides adding a few texts from stuff I gained for other modules I thought fit.  About 12 mb of data at 30%.*

***Tags:**  MILF, Cougar, Age difference, some noncon/dubious con, some GILFs, femdom, incest, older women, some group sex for flavor*

##### [Giantesses](https://files.catbox.moe/tg3z8m.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/371696139/#371791920)

*Well, I dunno if the mini-GTS anon will like it because it's the exact same material, but I've recreated the giantess module for Eute*

##### [Good Girls](https://files.catbox.moe/inwedu.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/371696139/#371719249)

*Alright lads, here's something I threw together from some short stories on asstr (/~illg/good)*

*\>These stories are all about sex and love and romance with pre-teen or young teen girls.*

*The stories' quality seem kind of hit or miss, but it wasn't hard to clean and didn't take too many steppies, so here is the Good Girls module.*

*Trained on 657 steps at 55.36%, because from a cursory look at this data, overtraining it would probably not be good. Let me know how it works.*

##### [Loli/Shota](https://files.catbox.moe/l492v0.module)

[procured by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/371696139/#371736508)

*I'm back with the small equines module. Top rated small horse degeneracy stories focused on the smallest horses. 2.25mb, 3k steps, 2.54 loss.*

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/371608780/#371662447)

*I trained a module on femsub hypnosis scripts. The quality of the training data is all over the place and it's probably a very bad idea to let Euterpe hypnotize you, but if anybody is interested, I've uploaded it here.*

##### [Respect (Second Person)](https://files.catbox.moe/pwihg8.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/371544232/#371571043)

*Age difference module. Excels at milfs with expected "imperfections" like grey streaks, a little sag, extra curves, extra hair etc.*

*Any compatibility with things like /ss/ and mother/son incest is totally incidental and not intended.*

##### [Furry ENF](https://files.catbox.moe/yctwti.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/371696139/#371703318)

*Here's my Furry ENF module again, for archive purposes I guess.*

*Euterpe's creativity seems to run away with this one sometimes, so it might double as a non-consent module or exhibitionist module. I'm not sure.*

##### [Furry Transformation](https://files.catbox.moe/wklqde.module)

[by Meraine](https://discord.com/channels/854479693503660032/939950910690439179/940054383280939048)

*A curated and hand-cleaned set of NSFW furry transformation stories from FurAffinity and Literotica.*

***Tags:** furry, transformation, tf, tftg, gay*

***Source Material:** 2.9MB, 2688 steps (85.26%)*

*There's a lot (these stories tend to be short), so I'll just list the authors, in order from most to least sampled:*
- Leo_Todrius (33)

- Kotep (12)
- AmethystMare (5)

- MissMarilith (1)
- wolphin (1)
- Cinos (1)
- danath (1)
- xerox2 (1)

*I tried to remove as many ellipses (...) as possible. Prior to editing, there were 2600 counts of some variation of ..., and after editing, only 304 remained. Em-dashes and double-hypens (--) were all converted to single hyphens (-).*

##### [Furry Yuri](https://files.catbox.moe/npu521.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/371544232/#371560452)

*Here's my furry yuri module again.*

*The loss graph crashed on this one halfway through, but I closed and repopened the UI and it was still training, and the loss ended up being about 0.05 less than Sigurd at the same steps used so I think it trained properly.*<br>
*Seems to pick up on the bondage influence in the training data more so than Sigurd did, so expect that.*

*I'm going to add some more data to my other furfag modules before I retrain them, if anyone cares.*

>She lifted her face from the vid and looked at me, expressionless.

>'It's... well, it's a bit complicated.'

>I nodded slowly. The water lapped gently around my shins, the waves washing over my ankles.
>
>'I'm listening,' I said.
>
>'It's the Hand of God.'
>
>I frowned. 'How do you mean?'
>
>'The Hand of God is a device, built by the government of Sanction to defeat the Syndicate. It uses quantum computing technology to create a self-regenerating hypervirus that kills every brain in the human genome. This happens to be a fairly useful thing for anyone with a personal grudge against their neighbours.'
>
>'Interesting.' I glanced back at the water, then down into the depths where the yellow moonlight gleamed on the still black ocean floor. 'What does this have to do with me?'
>
>'Well, I don't know if you noticed, but we're standing on the remains of the Hand of God.'
>
>'You think someone just dumped the thing in here? Just tossed it out like an unwanted pet?'
>
>'I don't know,' she said. 'But that's what I'd do if I was planning to kill everyone on the planet.' She paused for a moment, eyes fixed on her reflection in the water. 'I used to wonder why the Hand of God was so hard to track down. I mean, it's only one of a kind. Why not just hide it somewhere safe until they needed it again?'
>
>'Yeah, good point.' I shook my head. 'Maybe there was something else going on. Maybe this wasn't the Hand of God.'

*The King James Bible module.*

*Like in previous iterations of the module, this is with chapter titles and verse numbers intact. So like this:*

>FEMBOYS
>
>1:1 And so it came to be in the reign of Saul that there was a land of men that were like women.
>
>1:2 The men that were like women were large in number, their bodies soft and supple, yet their faces stern; their eyes beautiful, but their thoughts depraved;
>
>1:3 And these men that were like women were known to be the fairest in all the world, and much desired by all who saw them.

***Tags:** visual novel, transcript, courtroom*

***Sources:** Original trilogy, Apollo Justice, Dual Destinies, Spirit of Justice, Ace Attorney Investigations 1-2. 6160 steps at 100%, 2.35loss.*

***Notes:***
- *Bias for OBJECTION! and HOLD IT! for extra entertainment.*
- *Testimony, cross-examination and such are denoted by parentheses in the training data, e.g.( Cross examination: What Really Happened )*
- *The original dataset contains too many lines with ellipses only, which caused the previous (Sigurd) module to get stuck in loops. Dropped 70% of the ellipses-only lines to reduce the chances of this happening.*

>**Phoenix: OBJECTION!**
>
>Gumshoe: ...!?
>
>Edgeworth: There's no need to look at the video. We already know what it shows, don't we...?
>
>Athena: I've seen that scene so many times...

>Maya: ...It must have been terrifying for her!
>
>Blackquill: So? What does it show you? You've watched it a thousand times over already, haven't you?!
>
>Phoenix: This is my chance! If I can just prove that this was all part of Mr. Justice Minister's plan...
>
>Maya: Ohhh! That would be a lot harder than just saying it out loud!
>
>Phoenix: ...All right then, let me try something different. It might work better with this case.
>
>Athena: Hey now! Let's hear his idea first, before you start getting impatient and yelling "No fair" at him!
>
>Apollo: I'm ready! (Let me see! )
>
>Maya: Yeah! Let him explain things as he sees them! That should clear up any misunderstandings in the courtroom!
>
>Phoenix: Very well. I will attempt to convince you all by showing you exactly what happened on that fateful day.
>
>Athena: Yeehaw!

>**I grabbed my sword's hilt** and started running toward the source of the voice. I came out from behind a small boulder, my feet moving faster than usual, almost as if they knew where to step before I did.
>
>A young boy was on his knees, his hands in the air with a smile on his face. His body had been pierced through by a thick piece of wood that had been driven into the ground like a stake. A man in his late thirties was standing over him holding a bloody dagger.
>
>"No need for that," The old man said calmly. "We both know that you are going to come down here eventually."
>
>I drew my sword from its scabbard, not taking my eyes off the man. His stance wasn't overly aggressive, but then again he had just attacked the boy without warning. I was confident in my sword skills, so all I had to do was land my first strike and end this quickly. That being said though, I still didn't want to take any chances.
>
>The man smirked. "You're brave." He walked forward, still keeping his distance from me.
>
>I took a few steps back, putting more space between us. This wasn't working.
>
>"You know there is no point to continuing this. You have nothing." He raised his hand and pulled it back, revealing a blade of light that was now burning brightly. In my mind I could already see the scene playing out. The man would kill the boy and I would have no choice but to watch him go down.
>
>And then there was the issue of me being unarmed. The man had a dagger and an arcane blade; two types of weapons that were considered lethal by most standards. My only option was to end the fight right now.
>
>As the man brought the blade down, I let out a shout and dove to the side, my sword coming down at a diagonal angle.
>
>The man was quick, but not quite quick enough. I was able to deflect the attack with my sword. It was enough of a force that it sent his sword flying from his hands, but the man was unharmed, although his left arm was bleeding quite heavily. The arcane blade flew past me harmlessly, and then I took advantage of the momentary lapse in his guard. I thrust my sword upward, piercing into his chest with one fluid motion.

>**Recipe: Chocolate Salvation**
>
>MAKES 1 SERVING
>
>This is an adaptation of a traditional chocolate pudding that my mom used to make. She would serve it with some whipped cream on top, but I prefer it as just a rich, decadent pudding all by itself. The addition of the coconut oil and the cacao powder make this version really special. If you don't have any coconut or cacao powder, no worries—this recipe will still taste amazing without them!
>
> 6 tablespoons (100 g) unsalted butter
>
> 1 large egg
>
> 3-4 heaping tablespoons cacao powder (optional)
>
> ¼ teaspoon sea salt
>
> 2 tablespoons sugar
>
> 1 tablespoon pure maple syrup
>
> 1/8 cup heavy cream (or coconut milk for dairy free)
>
>INSTRUCTIONS: Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Set aside 2 tablespoons of the sugar and set aside to use later. In a medium saucepan combine the butter, cocoa, and water. Whisk continuously over low heat until it begins to thicken into a sauce-like consistency, about 10 minutes. Add the remaining sugar (about ¼ cup) and whisk constantly for another 3 minutes while bringing the temperature up to 240°F (115°C). At this point you want to remove from the heat but keep whisking, as it will continue to cook at this temperature, becoming thicker. When the temperature reaches 240°F add in the salt, the remaining sugar, and the egg and stir continuously with a wooden spoon until smooth. Remove from heat and let cool slightly. Place in fridge until cold. Once cooled whip the cream and spread atop your chilled pudding.

### [Michael Jackson Lyrics](https://files.catbox.moe/39ix7t.module)

***Data:** 262kb, 517 steps, 172.79%.*

*I'm a huge Michael Jackson fan. I originally made this module for Sigurd, but now I've ported it to Euterpe. Let's see what Euterpe will do if we feed her MJ lyrics! I compiled Michael Jackson's lyrics from his studio album solo discography into training data.*

***Source Material:***
*All of the songs from his solo studio album discography. The only stuff I didn't include is the demos from The Ultimate Collection in 2004, and most of the posthumous tracks from the Michael and Xscape albums. I omitted them mostly for philosophical reasons/out of respect, because Michael didn't like people hearing unfinished or unreleased stuff he did. The only exceptions to that were Hold My Hand and A Place With No Name which were basically finished and getting ready for release shortly before he died. I also included Xscape because I believe that had been intended for release at some point before it got leaked and he cancelled.*

***Headings? What?***

*Headings are stuff in the lyrics like Intro, Verse 1, Verse 2, Chorus, Bridge, Outro. That is not a definitive list of headings, but it's generally that sort of thing. Additionally I tagged every song like:*

    [Title: ; Artist: ; Genre: ; Tags: ]

*There were tags like duet, young MJ, adult MJ, happy, sad, angry, 70s, 80s, 90s, 2000s, social commentary, privacy, stalker, diss track, etc depending on the song.*

***What do I do with this module?***

*I dunno. Throw in some tags, then an "Intro", "Verse", or whatever headings if you like. I just made this for experimentation, and to use up some steps before they run out. Fuck around with the modules and do what you like.*

>**[Artist: Michael Jackson; Title: Billie Jean Smokes Weed; Genre: Rock, Metal; Tags: 90s, Adult MJ, Happy, stalker, drugs]**

>Verse 1:
>
>Hello, hello
>
>I'm back
>
>And I'm just the way you like me
>
>And I'm here to stay
>
>So get used to my face
>
>You're gonna see me everywhere
>
>Hey, hey, you'll never see my end
>
>Chorus:

>I'm a weed smoker,

>You're a weed smoker

>Too much smoke

>I'll make sure you get it
