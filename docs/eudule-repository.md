*I've trained my CS Lewis module for Euterpe V2. Tested and seems to be working extremely well, his style comes through much more strongly than it did with Sigurd.*

>**The mermaid sang upon the rocks,** and the gulls wheeled about her in a strange and ungraspable dance. And as they circled they saw beneath her the mermaid's arms were stretched out wide upon the sea, and her hands were empty: but the palms of her hands were covered with blood.
>
>And as the gulls cried out across the ocean to each other: "What is this?" one answered: "I have seen it before—in a dream." And then another said: "It is the time when the mermaid sleeps, and dreams of her lover." And yet another: "That is why we do not eat human flesh; for we know that the spirit sleeps, and that if we kill it, its soul shall come forth again from the grave."
>
>Then one of them cried out: "We are birds of sorrowful heart, for our hearts are heavy with sadness and grief." And all the birds, wherever they flew, sang together, and the mermaid slept.

>**The witch was mercurial and beautiful**
>
>With her black hair and black eyes,
>
>She lived alone on the mountain's heights,
>
>And she knew the secrets of all things.
>
>—Mallin de la Hame, The Song
`
>**The witch was mercurial and beautiful**, but her magic was like a snake in the grass. I'd thought she was coming for me because I knew about the potion, but it turned out to be something else entirely.
>
>She came to my bed one night when I was sleeping and woke me up. She told me she had a gift for me. It would make me happy and strong forever, and so much more than that. She would have been right, if only...
>
>My name is Alessia, and this is my story.
>
>***
>
>I woke to voices outside my window and looked out through the bars. A witch was there, a woman with skin like bronze, hair as dark as an owl's feathers. I could see she wasn't alone—there were other women standing behind her, all of them looking at me with hunger in their eyes. They were young, old, tall, short; they wore peasant dresses or gowns of fine linen; some held babies in their arms while others carried baskets on their backs. They were all different races, from all over the world—but they looked like sisters.
>
>"Alessia?" the witch asked me. "Is that you?"
>
>I realized then that I must have fallen asleep, curled up in my bed, and dreamed that she'd come for me. I wanted to tell her no, but I couldn't find my voice.
>
>The witch smiled, and I saw her face change from her own, to mine. And then she laughed, and said, "Oh, how lovely, dear girl."
>
>They all laughed then, as she led me down the stairs to meet them.

##### [Science Fantasy](https://files.catbox.moe/coib5d.module)

[by BaronJoshua](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/939922436500107314/940004284660084776)

*Science Fantasy is a genre that combines Science Fiction with elements of the Fantasy genre. Typically involving religion, philosophy, good vs evil, magic, science so advanced it's like magic, computerized gods, and robots. Star Wars is the most well known media franchise of the genre though Superhero fiction also tends to lap into this category.*

*This specific module mostly trained on Space Fantasy material, a Science Fantasy sub-genre. The supernatural, religion, starships, and machines are something to expect. Magic and Science tend to blur.*

*Major fandoms drawn from are Star Wars, Star Trek (select stories), Halo, Mass Effect, and 40K.*

##### [Surrealistic Look Through the Glass](https://files.catbox.moe/df2bf6.module)

[by OccultSage](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/939922436500107314/940023689427169301)

*This is a theme module for those that enjoy surrealistic, whimsical, and sometimes dark stories along the vein of Lewis Carrol's Alice's Adventure in Wonderland, or Neil Gaiman's Neverwhere.*

>**Morgan's brows furrowed, and he stared** down at the book. "You're sure? She was in there?"
>
>"It's true," said the white rabbit. He glanced at Alice again. His ears were very long, so long that they brushed the ground. "There, see? They are still moving."
>
>Morgan reached out for the book, but Alice snatched it back. The rabbit made no attempt to stop her; indeed, he seemed rather to encourage her, bobbing his head as she read.
>
>"It says here: 'And now, as winter draws in on its dark wings, and the moon moves farther from the earth, we bid you good night.' I don't understand it—I think perhaps it must be a poem or something," Alice said.
>
>"No, I'm pretty sure that's just what happens when the world ends," the rabbit said. "A poem—it says 'when winter draws in'—but I don't know how winter is drawing in."
>
>"Yes, well, that might be because the book doesn't seem to make any sense," Alice said. "It's written in a sort of code. It says something about a maze, and there's all these dots and things and lines crossed out and words that aren't even spelled right. I've tried to decipher it, but there are too many letters with multiple meanings. For example, it looks like the word 'moon' has more than one meaning. See, it says 'the moon is shining bright.' And then it also says 'and the moon moves farther from the earth.' And 'night,' and 'nighttime' and 'nightmare' and 'dreaming' and 'nightmares' and 'nightmares' and...well, you can see that it gets a little confusing."
>
>The rabbit smiled. "I don't think it is meant to make sense," he said.
>
>"Well, I still don't understand it," Alice said, glancing at the clock.

>**Once upon a time**, there was a very rich man who had four sons. The younger three were selfish and lazy. They did not like to work at all. They thought their father's money would continue to fall from the sky, so they did nothing but sit in their rooms reading books and making music all day long.
>
>One day, a beggar came up to them and asked for some food.
>
>The first son said, "Why should I feed you? You are a dirty old man."
>
>The second son said, "You have no manners. Get away from here, beggar!"
>
>The third son said, "I don't care what you think of me, but if my brothers give you food, then it is as good as mine."
>
>So he gave the beggar some food too. The beggar thanked him and left.
>Then the older brother said, "Now we will see whether our father really loves us or not."
>
>And they all sat down to wait. Soon after that, the eldest brother died, and soon after that the second brother died, and soon after that the youngest brother also died, and just when the oldest son was about to die, his coffin broke open. All his gold fell out onto the ground.
>Then the richest man in the kingdom saw this and said, "Here is a strange thing! If the dead brothers did not need any food, how could the eldest son die?"
##### [The Great War](https://files.catbox.moe/ke8xa6.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/371544232/#371552753)

*Updated the WW1 module for Euterpe*

> \>what went into this?

*Autism. Autism went into that, along with All Quiet on the Western Front by Erich Maria Remarque, A Storm of Steel by Ernst Jünger, Under Fire by Henri Barbusse , poems by Wilfred Own, Infantry Attacks by Rommel, and more.*<br>
*Basically first person past tense accounts of infantry on the western front, both historical and fictional to hopefully give an impression of the horrors of early 20th century combat and the disaffected ruined youth of that generation.*

*I'll probably eventually whip up editions for the east, Italian front, and air combat.*

##### [Western (Romance)](https://files.catbox.moe/1fk9a8.module)

[by OccultSage](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/939922436500107314/940026736547094618)

*Yee haw! This module focuses on the Western Romance genre, but is leavened out by ordinary Westerns. LGBT and People of Color perspectives were also added in. Have fun roundin' them all up!*

***NOTE:** This is the same module that has been re-trained on Euterpe.*

>**She rode, and rode after the love of her life**, but he had already gone west. Her heart was broken and she cried for days, weeks, and months. She vowed to follow him and bring him back.
>
>The long winter months passed quickly for her. It wasn't so much the cold that bothered her as it was knowing that there would be no more joy in the warmth of his arms. There was no comfort in this cold season, only a longing for the man who stole her heart.
>
>On Christmas Day, she was awakened by the sound of hooves on the frozen ground. For a moment, she thought it was a dream—the memory of another time and place when they were together. She rose from the bed and walked softly downstairs to investigate. The horses were harnessed up to the wagon and ready to go. She had not seen the wagon in the yard since before she left Texas. He was coming home to her!
>
>"It's too early," she whispered to herself. "He will be here at midnight, or even later." She slipped out the back door and headed toward the barn. As she crossed the yard, she noticed a faint glow of light in the barn window.
>
>"Is he here?" she wondered. She drew nearer. No one answered, but she could see a lantern hanging inside the barn. She felt a little foolish sneaking into the barn, but she was so excited, she couldn't help herself. She hurried inside and found him in the loft, fast asleep. He looked so handsome and peaceful. She smiled as she saw the quilt thrown over his legs.
>
>He stirred at the sound of her voice. His eyes opened slowly. Then, with a start, he recognized her.
>
>"Oh, my God! What are you doing here?" He tried to sit up but quickly fell back onto the hay. "I am sorry, I didn't mean to wake you. But it is so good to see you again."
>
>"It's good to see you again, too," she said softly. She crawled across the loft to join him, careful not to make any noise. His body was warm under the quilt and he felt so right.
>
>"It has been too long," he said. "I have missed you."

>**The alien girl with tentacles approached me, and my eyes were arrested** by the beauty of her face. She was so beautiful that I forgot to breathe. The human man standing next to me became aware of the situation and looked at me as if he had never seen me before in his life. I felt a slight shiver of embarrassment from him. He didn't know me, but he was looking at me as if I was an animal.
>
>The alien girl was smiling at me, and it felt like my heart was going to leap out of my body. It felt like a great wave was coming from her, and it washed over me with all of its power. My heart was beating faster, and I couldn't stop staring at her. She looked like she could be my own daughter, or maybe my sister. There was such a strong sense of family between us that we would have been related somehow.
>
>"Please, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Fuchi, and I am an alien from another planet," the girl said. "You must be one of those humans that I read about."
>
>"Yes. I'm a human," I replied.
>
>"I can tell that you are a very intelligent creature. Your mind is much more developed than many others," she said.
>
>"Thank you for your compliment. We don't hear them very often," I answered.
>
>She giggled, and I realized that she was talking to me like we had known each other for a long time. There was a sense of familiarity between us. Her tentacles swayed slowly back and forth, and they were trying to pull me in closer to her. As she moved them, I got the feeling that I was being pulled toward her in the same way. I wanted to hold her in my arms, but I couldn't do it. It wasn't right to do that with someone who wasn't human. I could feel her warmth through our connection. She was so warm, and I couldn't resist her pull.
>"Come with me," she said.
>
>As I followed her, I felt like I was leaving behind everyone and everything that I knew.

>**The succubus laughed and approached me with her hips swaying**. She was wearing a tight black dress that clung to her body, accentuating her hourglass figure. She had on a long silk drape that was tied around her neck but fell off one shoulder and down the opposite side of her torso. Her long hair was tied back and flowed down her back in a black waterfall. I could see the tattoo of an angel on her chest as it swam out from under her dress. "I have some news for you." The succubus spoke seductively.
>
>"That is not how we do things," I told her sternly.
>
>"You will be my toy for a year or until I am finished with you," she replied as if she knew what was going through my head. "I don't need your permission for anything."
>
>"This is unacceptable! You are not even my mistress yet!" I said angrily.
>The succubus bent over and pulled down on the front of her dress. She let it fall off her shoulders and it fell all the way to the floor. She stood up again, exposing herself completely. Her nipples were hard and her breasts jiggled with every move she made.
>
>"Are you happy?" she asked looking at me defiantly.
>
>"No, I'm not," I replied. My heart started racing as I looked at her perfect body.
>
>"Then be quiet and play with your new body," she said as she walked over to me.
>
>I felt my dick start to stir as she got closer. The succubus sat on the edge of the table and spread her legs wide. She pushed her tits together and slid her hand between them. Her fingers moved quickly as they circled her nipples. Her eyes closed and her mouth opened slightly as she moaned in pleasure.
>
>"I am so wet right now," she whispered as her hand disappeared into her pussy. She wiggled her hips as she pumped her hand furiously.
>
>She leaned forward and looked at me. "Do you want to feel this?"
>
>I nodded my head and reached out to touch her. Her skin was silky smooth and warm against my palm. When I touched her, she shivered with pleasure. I watched her lick her lips as I rubbed her pussy. She opened her thighs wider, allowing me better access.

>*The wolf man approached me, his arousal already evident, knot swelling.* He seemed to be waiting for something before he made any further moves.
>
>"I don't understand," I said. "What is it you want?"
>
>He smiled, flashing his teeth. "You have the scent of a woman on your lips, my dear. And the taste of one in your mouth." His fingers trailed over my cheek and down the side of my neck. "And the feel of another inside you, yes?" He licked at my earlobe, then bit down hard enough to draw blood. I yelped and pressed closer to him.
>
>"Yes, it's true," I said. "I've done that with someone. A man. It was wonderful."
>
>"Then you must give me what he didn't." The wolf-man leaned forward, his hand sliding from my hip to my thigh. His palm spread against my skin as his fingers curled under the hem of my dress. My breath caught as his hand slid upward until it rested right below my ass. I shivered as his fingers grazed the bare skin there. "Will you allow me to do this for you? Please?"
>
>I nodded, not trusting myself to speak.
>
>His hand slid up my leg, slipping beneath the skirt of my dress. The wolf-man's fingertips brushed against my cunt, sending little ripples through me. His other arm wrapped around my waist, pulling me tight against him. I felt his hard cock press between us, but he held me away from him.
>
>"Tell me, sweet girl, if you would like me to touch you there." He ran the tip of his finger along the seam of my pussy. "Or do you prefer that I just lick you and make you come for me?"
>
>I moaned when he pressed two fingers inside me. His thumb rubbed against my clit. "Do it," I breathed. "Lick me. Make me come."
>
>The wolf-man licked at my pussy, drawing more moans from me. I gripped at the edge of his desk, unable to hold still. The sensation was too much. Too good. His tongue moved over me, tasting and exploring. Then he shifted, his fingers sliding out of my cunt. The wolf-man took hold of my legs and spread them wide apart. My feet were trapped between us, my ankles dangling over the edge of his desk. I moaned again as his tongue slid against my clit, rubbing softly.
>
>"Tell me, my dear," he said as he continued to tease my clit with his tongue. "Have you ever had your pussy eaten before?"
>
>"No," I said.
>
>"Is that because you don't know how it's done or is it simply a matter that you haven't found someone to do it?"
>
>"It's just not something that men have done to me." I looked at him over my shoulder. His eyes gleamed with hunger and lust. "But now... I am yours. You may do whatever you please to me."
>
>The wolf-man lifted his head and looked into my eyes. "Then you may be sure that I will make you come many times tonight. For I will enjoy tasting every inch of your body, sweet girl."
>
>He returned to my pussy, licking and sucking. I could feel his saliva dripping down my thighs as he worked me with his mouth. His fingers stroked into me and out. The way he touched me caused my breath to quicken. I could barely contain the pleasure building inside me.
>
>"I need you," I gasped. "I need your cock. Give it to me. Please."
>
>The wolf-man slid off the desk, his hands closing around my hips as he turned me. He pressed me back against it, his fingers sliding beneath my dress to grasp my ass cheeks. My back arched as he bent me over the desk, his cock pressing against my wet pussy. I could smell my own sex and it filled my nostrils. The wolf-man pressed his cock against me and slid inside me. I cried out at the feeling of being filled by such a huge cock. My ass pressed against the edge of the desk.

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/371544232/#371545765)

*I'm back with the small equines module. Top rated small horse degeneracy stories focused on the smallest horses. 2.25mb, 3k steps, 2.54 loss.*

##### [Age Difference](https://files.catbox.moe/r8t3j0.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/371544232/#371568079)

*Age difference module. Excels at milfs with expected "imperfections" like grey streaks, a little sag, extra curves, extra hair etc.*

*Any compatibility with things like /ss/ and mother/son incest is totally incidental and not intended.*

##### [Furry Yuri](https://files.catbox.moe/npu521.module)

[by Anon](https://arch.b4k.co/vg/thread/371544232/#371560452)

*Here's my furry yuri module again.*

*The loss graph crashed on this one halfway through, but I closed and repopened the UI and it was still training, and the loss ended up being about 0.05 less than Sigurd at the same steps used so I think it trained properly.*<br>
*Seems to pick up on the bondage influence in the training data more so than Sigurd did, so expect that.*

*I'm going to add some more data to my other furfag modules before I retrain them, if anyone cares.*

#### [Ace Attorney](https://files.catbox.moe/6dd8op.module)

[by Dead Eye](https://discord.com/channels/836774308772446268/939922436500107314/940037982285594704)

*OBJECTION! Trained on transcripts from Ace Attorney, visual novel series known for courtroom drama and detective work.*
***Tags:** visual novel, transcript, courtroom*

***Sources:** Original trilogy, Apollo Justice, Dual Destinies, Spirit of Justice, Ace Attorney Investigations 1-2. 6160 steps at 100%, 2.35loss.*

***Notes:***
- *Bias for OBJECTION! and HOLD IT! for extra entertainment.*
- *Testimony, cross-examination and such are denoted by parentheses in the training data, e.g.( Cross examination: What Really Happened )*
- *The original dataset contains too many lines with ellipses only, which caused the previous (Sigurd) module to get stuck in loops. Dropped 70% of the ellipses-only lines to reduce the chances of this happening.*

>**Phoenix: OBJECTION!**
>
>Gumshoe: ...!?
>
>Edgeworth: There's no need to look at the video. We already know what it shows, don't we...?
>
>Athena: I've seen that scene so many times...
>
>Maya: ...It must have been terrifying for her!
>
>Blackquill: So? What does it show you? You've watched it a thousand times over already, haven't you?!
>
>Phoenix: This is my chance! If I can just prove that this was all part of Mr. Justice Minister's plan...
>
>Maya: Ohhh! That would be a lot harder than just saying it out loud!
>
>Phoenix: ...All right then, let me try something different. It might work better with this case.
>
>Athena: Hey now! Let's hear his idea first, before you start getting impatient and yelling "No fair" at him!
>
>Apollo: I'm ready! (Let me see! )
>
>Maya: Yeah! Let him explain things as he sees them! That should clear up any misunderstandings in the courtroom!
>
>Phoenix: Very well. I will attempt to convince you all by showing you exactly what happened on that fateful day.
>
>Athena: Yeehaw!

***Sources:** Saga of Tanya the Evil - Volumes 1-8, Carlo Zen, Yen Press Translation  (4.3mb, 4482 steps, 88.88% coverage, 2.8934 loss)*

*I suggest downbiasing newlines, Carlo Zen uses a lot of them, as you can see below. Reminder that the narrator considers Tanya as a different person than himself, even though they are the same people.*

>
>JERRY: You know what I'm talking about!
>
>ELAINE: Oh my God! Are you saying that there is some sort of emergency situation here?!

>
>JERRY: Wait a minute. We're not going anywhere until we find out where they keep the restrooms around here.
