*Science Fantasy is a genre that combines Science Fiction with elements of the Fantasy genre. Typically involving religion, philosophy, good vs evil, magic, science so advanced it's like magic, computerized gods, and robots. Star Wars is the most well known media franchise of the genre though Superhero fiction also tends to lap into this category.*

*This specific module mostly trained on Space Fantasy material, a Science Fantasy sub-genre. The supernatural, religion, starships, and machines are something to expect. Magic and Science tend to blur.*

*Major fandoms drawn from are Star Wars, Star Trek (select stories), Halo, Mass Effect, and 40K.*

*Drawing from across all sorts of genres ranging from science fiction to fantasy and western romances, this module mixes in quite a bit of spiciness -- or in the words of George Takei, "Oh My!"*

>**The alien girl with tentacles approached me, and my eyes were arrested** by the beauty of her face. She was so beautiful that I forgot to breathe. The human man standing next to me became aware of the situation and looked at me as if he had never seen me before in his life. I felt a slight shiver of embarrassment from him. He didn't know me, but he was looking at me as if I was an animal.
>
>The alien girl was smiling at me, and it felt like my heart was going to leap out of my body. It felt like a great wave was coming from her, and it washed over me with all of its power. My heart was beating faster, and I couldn't stop staring at her. She looked like she could be my own daughter, or maybe my sister. There was such a strong sense of family between us that we would have been related somehow.
>
>"Please, allow me to introduce myself. My name is Fuchi, and I am an alien from another planet," the girl said. "You must be one of those humans that I read about."
>
>"Yes. I'm a human," I replied.
>
>"I can tell that you are a very intelligent creature. Your mind is much more developed than many others," she said.
>
>"Thank you for your compliment. We don't hear them very often," I answered.
>
>She giggled, and I realized that she was talking to me like we had known each other for a long time. There was a sense of familiarity between us. Her tentacles swayed slowly back and forth, and they were trying to pull me in closer to her. As she moved them, I got the feeling that I was being pulled toward her in the same way. I wanted to hold her in my arms, but I couldn't do it. It wasn't right to do that with someone who wasn't human. I could feel her warmth through our connection. She was so warm, and I couldn't resist her pull.
>"Come with me," she said.
>
>As I followed her, I felt like I was leaving behind everyone and everything that I knew.

>**The succubus laughed and approached me with her hips swaying**. She was wearing a tight black dress that clung to her body, accentuating her hourglass figure. She had on a long silk drape that was tied around her neck but fell off one shoulder and down the opposite side of her torso. Her long hair was tied back and flowed down her back in a black waterfall. I could see the tattoo of an angel on her chest as it swam out from under her dress. "I have some news for you." The succubus spoke seductively.
>
>"That is not how we do things," I told her sternly.
>
>"You will be my toy for a year or until I am finished with you," she replied as if she knew what was going through my head. "I don't need your permission for anything."
>
>"This is unacceptable! You are not even my mistress yet!" I said angrily.
>The succubus bent over and pulled down on the front of her dress. She let it fall off her shoulders and it fell all the way to the floor. She stood up again, exposing herself completely. Her nipples were hard and her breasts jiggled with every move she made.
>
>"Are you happy?" she asked looking at me defiantly.
>
>"No, I'm not," I replied. My heart started racing as I looked at her perfect body.
>
>"Then be quiet and play with your new body," she said as she walked over to me.
>
>I felt my dick start to stir as she got closer. The succubus sat on the edge of the table and spread her legs wide. She pushed her tits together and slid her hand between them. Her fingers moved quickly as they circled her nipples. Her eyes closed and her mouth opened slightly as she moaned in pleasure.
>
>"I am so wet right now," she whispered as her hand disappeared into her pussy. She wiggled her hips as she pumped her hand furiously.
>
>She leaned forward and looked at me. "Do you want to feel this?"
>
>I nodded my head and reached out to touch her. Her skin was silky smooth and warm against my palm. When I touched her, she shivered with pleasure. I watched her lick her lips as I rubbed her pussy. She opened her thighs wider, allowing me better access.

>*The wolf man approached me, his arousal already evident, knot swelling.* He seemed to be waiting for something before he made any further moves.
>
>"I don't understand," I said. "What is it you want?"
>
>He smiled, flashing his teeth. "You have the scent of a woman on your lips, my dear. And the taste of one in your mouth." His fingers trailed over my cheek and down the side of my neck. "And the feel of another inside you, yes?" He licked at my earlobe, then bit down hard enough to draw blood. I yelped and pressed closer to him.
>
>"Yes, it's true," I said. "I've done that with someone. A man. It was wonderful."
>
>"Then you must give me what he didn't." The wolf-man leaned forward, his hand sliding from my hip to my thigh. His palm spread against my skin as his fingers curled under the hem of my dress. My breath caught as his hand slid upward until it rested right below my ass. I shivered as his fingers grazed the bare skin there. "Will you allow me to do this for you? Please?"
>
>I nodded, not trusting myself to speak.
>
>His hand slid up my leg, slipping beneath the skirt of my dress. The wolf-man's fingertips brushed against my cunt, sending little ripples through me. His other arm wrapped around my waist, pulling me tight against him. I felt his hard cock press between us, but he held me away from him.
>
>"Tell me, sweet girl, if you would like me to touch you there." He ran the tip of his finger along the seam of my pussy. "Or do you prefer that I just lick you and make you come for me?"
>
>I moaned when he pressed two fingers inside me. His thumb rubbed against my clit. "Do it," I breathed. "Lick me. Make me come."
>
>The wolf-man licked at my pussy, drawing more moans from me. I gripped at the edge of his desk, unable to hold still. The sensation was too much. Too good. His tongue moved over me, tasting and exploring. Then he shifted, his fingers sliding out of my cunt. The wolf-man took hold of my legs and spread them wide apart. My feet were trapped between us, my ankles dangling over the edge of his desk. I moaned again as his tongue slid against my clit, rubbing softly.
>
>"Tell me, my dear," he said as he continued to tease my clit with his tongue. "Have you ever had your pussy eaten before?"
>
>"No," I said.
>
>"Is that because you don't know how it's done or is it simply a matter that you haven't found someone to do it?"
>
>"It's just not something that men have done to me." I looked at him over my shoulder. His eyes gleamed with hunger and lust. "But now... I am yours. You may do whatever you please to me."
>
>The wolf-man lifted his head and looked into my eyes. "Then you may be sure that I will make you come many times tonight. For I will enjoy tasting every inch of your body, sweet girl."
>
>He returned to my pussy, licking and sucking. I could feel his saliva dripping down my thighs as he worked me with his mouth. His fingers stroked into me and out. The way he touched me caused my breath to quicken. I could barely contain the pleasure building inside me.
>
>"I need you," I gasped. "I need your cock. Give it to me. Please."
>
>The wolf-man slid off the desk, his hands closing around my hips as he turned me. He pressed me back against it, his fingers sliding beneath my dress to grasp my ass cheeks. My back arched as he bent me over the desk, his cock pressing against my wet pussy. I could smell my own sex and it filled my nostrils. The wolf-man pressed his cock against me and slid inside me. I cried out at the feeling of being filled by such a huge cock. My ass pressed against the edge of the desk.
