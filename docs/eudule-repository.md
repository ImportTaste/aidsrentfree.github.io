*Science Fantasy is a genre that combines Science Fiction with elements of the Fantasy genre. Typically involving religion, philosophy, good vs evil, magic, science so advanced it's like magic, computerized gods, and robots. Star Wars is the most well known media franchise of the genre though Superhero fiction also tends to lap into this category.*

*This specific module mostly trained on Space Fantasy material, a Science Fantasy sub-genre. The supernatural, religion, starships, and machines are something to expect. Magic and Science tend to blur.*

*Major fandoms drawn from are Star Wars, Star Trek (select stories), Halo, Mass Effect, and 40K.*

*Embark on a journey of mayhem and warcrimes in Totally-Not-WW1 Europe and leave a trail of magical destruction in your wake, all while debating philosophy and ethnocentrism with God Being X, that absolute jackass.*

***Tags:** Military, WW1, Low Fantasy, Magic Realism, Attack and Dethrone God*

***Sources:** Saga of Tanya the Evil - Volumes 1-8, Carlo Zen, Yen Press Translation  (4.3mb, 4482 steps, 88.88% coverage, 2.8934 loss)*

*I suggest downbiasing newlines, Carlo Zen uses a lot of them, as you can see below. Reminder that the narrator considers Tanya as a different person than himself, even though they are the same people.*

*What's the deal with euterpe?*

***Tags:** Seinfeld, George, Jerry, Elaine, Kramer, TV, Comedy*

***Sources:** Around half of the Seinfeld scripts, trained to 1.5 epochs.*

*It is advised that you turn off bracket bans.*

*The format is as follows.*

    [SCENE: ...] - Scene change.
    (action) - Actions

>**[Scene: A large castle.]**
>
>JERRY: (to Elaine) I think you should go to the bathroom.
>
>ELAINE: Why?
>
>JERRY: Because it's a long way down that staircase, and if something happens...
>
>(Elaine looks at him.)
>
>ELAINE: What are you talking about?
>
>JERRY: You know what I'm talking about!
>
>ELAINE: Oh my God! Are you saying that there is some sort of emergency situation here?!
>
>JERRY: No, no, no! It's just a precautionary measure.
>
>ELAINE: Well, I don't have time for this. I've got to get back in there.
>
>JERRY: Wait a minute. We're not going anywhere until we find out where they keep the restrooms around here.
>
>ELAINE: Jerry! This is ridiculous!
>
>JERRY: Look, I can tell by your face that you need to use the restroom. So let me help you with that.
>
>ELAINE: Okay, okay. Let's go.
>
>(They walk over to the guard who is standing near the door.)
>
>GUARD: Excuse me sir. Can I help you?
>
>JERRY: Yes, we were wondering where the bathrooms are located.
>
>GUARD: The restrooms are right through those doors.
>
>ELAINE: Thank you very much.
>
>(The two exit the room and head towards the doors.)
>
>GUARD: Good luck.
>
>JERRY: Thanks.
