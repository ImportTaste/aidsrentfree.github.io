# Theme Event Fridays

Sorted in **descending** order of recency, this is a log of all of the theme Friday submissions, starting from mid May 2021. There was [a previous one](https://guide.aidg.club/Resources-And-Guides/aidg%20general/aidg-Fridays.html), but it seems to be kill, so I've created this one as a fresh start.

## Rules

- A link to your prompt must posted in the thread.
  - Said link must be to prompts.aidg.club.
- Your submission must be posted as a reply to an anchor post made **on or near to the Friday** of the event.
  - An image is optional, but recommended. Not for any particular reason other than it makes my job easier.
- Please at least try.
- ~~Explore link is optional as well.~~ Well, we certainly aren't doing that anymore.

### The Friday of *Personality Alteration*

Let's make prompts ignoring modern psychology completely, using hypnosis or other mind breaking things as tools to change one's identity.

*August 20th, 2021*

#### *Measuring the Effects of Increased Sexual Arousal when Consuming Love Potions*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/1999>*

>*OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study is to determine the effects of ingestion of Hyde Love Potion on the subject's sexual arousal. Secondary objectives include determining physiological changes (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure, temperature) and psychological changes (e.g., mood, anxiety, aggression) related to increased arousal. Along with this, this study aims to document specifically the changes in male and female participants.*

A documentation of the effects of Hyde brand Love Potions on participants. This study aims to measure the changes of mood and personality when potions are consumed.

This paper was prepared by Anonne Mause and Jerkyll Hyde of the University of London.

#### *Sex Slave Headset*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/2030>*

>*However, a simple software mod is implemented within a few days that completely disables the ability to reverse the process. The product is recalled as it becomes less of a roleplay device and more of a sex slave creator. You, however, not only kept yours, but bought a hundred of these devices.*

You are a lecherous creep who cares little for the concept of "consent"

#### *Re: Programmed to Serve*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/2031>*

![](https://files.catbox.moe/8pmv9c.jpg)

>*"Huh? What do you mean?" I ask. "You talking about Silvia there? Never gonna happen. That chick would rather be repurposed as a calculator than to serve me. She fucking hates me!"*
>
>*"Reprogramming her would be trivial to me," the man says nonchalantly. "I'm giving you an opportunity here, I can make her act any way you want and follow any order you give her. I suggest you take it."*
>
>*I chuckle at how absurd his proposal is.*
>
>*"Ha! Alright, buddy. If you can make the stern and rigid Silvia suddenly act like a cock-hungry bimbo that wants nothing but to fuck herself on my cock instead of wanting to arrest me, then I'd love to see it!" I jokingly say.*
>
>*The man sighs. "Typical."*

In a futuristic dystopia, help a revolutionary obtain a key piece of technology, and in return, receive a sex slave in the form of the hot android cop chick that was giving you chase!

#### *The Controller*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/2032>*

>*“This device isn’t for controlling TVs, no! It’s for controlling people” he says, a glimmer of madness in his eyes.*
>
>*“People?” you ask, you might as well humour him.*
>
>*“Yes people!” he exclaims, “If you point this at someone and press the green button then…” he trails off.*
>
>*“Then what?” you ask, slightly curious even though it’s probably a load of nonsense.*
>
>*“Then they become under your spell!” he waves his left hand, his right clasping the object. You realise that he stinks, he smells of something you recognise but can’t put your finger on it.*
>
>*You raise an eyebrow, “Oh really?”.*
>
>*“Yes, yes! If you press the green button whilst pointing this at someone they will do anything you tell them to do, anything!” he has a crazed smile on his face. “The best part is they won’t remember a thing!”*
>
>*“That sounds rather sketchy…” you say uncomfortably, and take a step backwards.*
>
>*“It’s fine, it’s fine! I call the object, the ‘Controller’!” he puffs his chest out proudly.*
>
>*“Very creative” you mutter, what a load of nonsense.

You encounter a strange man walking home from work and come into possession of an object that is claimed to have immense power. Does it actually work? Can it do what the strange man claims? Why don’t you try it out?

#### *MOONLIGHT WHITE*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/2033>*

![](https://files.catbox.moe/kkqqxf.png)

>*A couple of hours ago, the county emergency broadcast blared out on all channels, advising us to stay indoors because a "dangerous meteorological event was taking place". I don't know shit about meteors. I took heed, but the broadcast got weird. Contradictory information and instructions, all focused on the event, the night sky. It wasn't a fucking meteor.*
>
>*Something's up with the moon. And to look at it means death. Or something close to it. You can't let moonlight seep in from your windows—mirrors are a no go. The announcement said nothing about the how, the why, or what the county is doing about it. I doubt anyone is coming. This feels like the end of days.*

A prompt where there's something terribly wrong with the night sky.

#### *The Mind-Bender's Challenge*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/2034>*

![](https://files.catbox.moe/mj6jpc.jpg)

>*Now standing before her, I started to wonder if I would meet the same fate as my predecessors. Not likely, I mused grimly as I looked at her collection of slaves. She seems to prefer women.*
>
>*With my first step into the chamber, I could feel the strength of her psychic powers. Already she was probing at my mind, searching for weaknesses. I focused, resolute to show her none.*
>
>*With a practiced breath, I let out my control lines and began to probe her mind in turn. It was only for a split second, but I knew I saw that unmistakable look on her face: the look of surprise. The Mindflayer was not the only psychic in the room.*

A rare breed of monster hunter, you are the Mind-Bender, a master of psychic battles. You are facing what could be your toughest opponent yet, a powerful Mindflayer. Best this creature in a contest of will to free the many slaves she keeps and to save your own life from her treacherous intentions! Equally matched in power to you, this foe will not go down without a fight. Remember, to the victor go the spoils.

#### *Mind Control Thingy*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/2035>*

>*I did not remember what it was that I had just dreamed about, but the memory still lingered in my mind like a ghostly echo.*
>
>*"You're my puppet!" A soft feminine voice whispered in my mind. It sounded so close at hand; it might have been inside my own skull, echoing through all the hidden recesses of my brain.*
>
>*"Don't try to deny it!" She laughed, the sound causing my skin to crawl. "You do whatever I tell you to, don't you? I control you completely!"*
>
>*"N-no..." I stammered. "No... Please! You're wrong... I control my own body..."*
>
>*"You're right, I'm not in your head," she said softly. "I'm not making your arm rise right now, am I?"*

Get controlled by a disembodied voice in your head.

#### *Con-fidence at the Con*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/2037>*

>*"Hmmph!" She snarls. "I'm not going to let my spot as the cutest 'girl' be taken by you. I'm going to show you how I'm still the queen of getting action at this con." Madoka says, running a hand suggestively over her flat chest.*
>
>*You blush. Did Madoka really say she was going to get laid more than you? Sure, it was something you had thought about and some of your manga weren't exactly allowed on a Christian website, but it probably wasn't going to happen anyway. You weren't that important after all..*
>
>*You shake your head. That was something Jay would think. Here you were Sakura, and she wouldn't stand for that kind of self doubt! You wouldn't stand for it.*

Play as teenage trap at their first anime convention trying to gain confidence by defeating your trap rival.

***

### The Friday of *Dwarves*

Let's make prompts ignoring boorish elves completely, using dwarves or other dwarvish things as tools and alcohol.

*August 6th, 2021*

#### *Out of the Furnace, Into the...*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/1867>*

![](https://files.catbox.moe/kq56me.jpg)

>*"I'm g-gonna gut t-that Elf slut."*
>
>*"Gildy?" Her pet name wasn't too far from her actual.*
>
>*Mustering some courage, Gilda turned to face you; a child. It was her alright, that you could tell, but Gilda was quite clearly a few decades younger, if not a century.*
>
>*You paused taking in her slightly revealed, nude form. Gilda's usual freckles were in place but look oh so adorable in the moment! Long, honey wheat-colored hair retaining much of its length, a single braid rested over her exposed shoulder and easily fell to her waist. Body wise....was it ok to see her like this? You couldn't fully tell but many of Gilda's thick Dwarven assets were very much depleted; there was still an alluring shape to her frame though you dared not admit it.*

Iron-Hand Arms. The lovechild of you and your Dwarven business associate Gilda. All is going well until an old grudge results in Gilda being cursed with age regression; it appears the curse has some other side-effects as well.

#### *Deep Rock Galactic*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/1917>*

![](https://files.catbox.moe/f82ms8.jpg)

>*Tense moments passed before Mission Control cut in again, "Miners… I've got some bad news. The Pod is completely shot. We'll be able to extract the Mule and its payload with secondaries, but as for you…" The faintest hint of genuine apology crept into the voice of the Mission Control operator, "The Company expresses its most sincere apologies and regrets, but you're stranded. Mitigating factors. Our hands are tied. Deep Rock Galactic will record your sacrifice. Sorry boys." The link went dead.*
>
>*The Dwarves looked at one another with apprehension. They were thousands of meters underground, surrounded by endless multitudes of insectoid abominations, low on ammo, with only each other to depend on for survival. "Well, there's no use crying over spilt beer, is there?" the Gunner snorted, chomping on his cigar.*

A mission goes wrong when the Drop Pod fails to extract. Abandoned thousands of meters underground by Mission Control, the Dwarves are determined to return to the Space Rig.

#### *Urist's Tryst*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/1918>*

![](https://files.catbox.moe/osatf3.jpg)

>*At last, he stumbled down the side passage he'd dug earlier that day, rounding a corner to behold her before him.*
>
>*She was like a vision torn straight from his wildest fantasies. Her beauty gleamed like a precious gem, though even the most valuable diamond was worthless in comparison to her. She was set into the wall of the cavern, her silvery surface clad only in bare stone, the rock wall hugging her form tightly in it's unyielding embrace. The mere sight of her was enough to weaken Urist's knees, to set his heart pounding furiously in his chest.*
>
>*Trading his empty flagon for the pickaxe he'd left there earlier, the dwarf approached her almost timidly, struck by her beauty.*
>
>*"It's me, Urist," he slurred, stars dancing in his eyes. "I've come for you."*

A dwarf, Urist, is possessed by a strange mood, and makes his way deep into the mines for a moonlight rendezvous.

***

### The Friday of *School*

Let's make prompts ignoring Mormon's trash filter completely, using students or other academic concepts as tools for storytelling.
*July 23rd, 2021*

#### *Clair de Lune*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/1787>*

![](https://files.catbox.moe/ph5249.jpg)

>*I feel my emotions conflict between the hate I thought I had for him and the genuine enjoyment I had talking with him on the phone earlier when I didn't know it was James. Was I just being set up for a fall here, or could it be that none of us had ever seen the true face of James and I'm seeing something he only shows to a very select few? At the very least, I should do what he says, given that he could have me expelled with a wave of his hand, so I grab a nearby stool and sit close to him as I watch in awe.*

A mysterious call for piano students on the school pin board has gotten me closer to the school's hated rich kid than I ever thought I would, and it turns out he's just a scared boy that wants someone to like him for who he is[.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ea2WoUtbzuw)

#### *Beneath The Cherry Blossoms*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/1788>*

![](https://files.catbox.moe/1gtu90.png)

>*I feel stupid. How did I think that I could hide something from Akari? But any sort of negative feelings I could have had just fly away as I feel her hand brush against my cheek before carefully cupping it. My eyes meet hers again, and I wonder how I could have, even for a moment, thought that this meant that she would think less of me. I'm sure she knows of my trepidation, my worries... but now that it's been all laid out with just a few gestures and words, there's no reason to ever hold back anymore. Her thumb caresses my cheek like a mother would do to a troubled child to calm it down again, those motherly notions that Akari had for me coming to the forefront again. She really just wants me to be my best, and that includes being open with my feelings. I realize that now.*

Two childhood friends find themselves realizing that the feelings they have for each other are starting to go beyond just friendship. And as they sit below a cherry blossom tree after school, they have a moment that will change their relationship forever.

#### *Quarterback Sneak*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/1789>*

![](https://files.catbox.moe/8df2he.jpg)

>*Might I have actually found a soulmate? Someone I could finally confide my desires in? Someone that wouldn't judge me? The thought seems too good to be true, but here I am, and when I look into Simon's eyes... I can see nothing but sincerity there. He's genuinely wanting to help me. But before I can reply, something strange happens. Emotions start bubbling up inside of me, and before I know it, tears are starting to form in my eyes. It's like all the pent up fear over being exposed has come back all at once now that I feel free.*

When I, the star quarterback of the school, was caught in my hobby of wearing women's panties in secret by a diminutive nerd, I thought my athletic career was either over or worse, I was going to be blackmailed. But when the nerd simply gave me a piece of paper with his address that told me to come over at midnight, I found myself in an intimate night of revelations about myself.

#### *Morning Commute*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/1791>*

![](https://files.catbox.moe/prksn5.png)

>*"Classic Erin, always modest," I said with a mock-sigh as I plopped down on the bench beside her. Erin chuckled lightly at that, and I smiled back at her. We sat in companionable silence, sipping our coffee and munching on the bread, as we watched the sky. I could see the faintest hint of the sun peeking over the horizon, casting a glow across the snow-dusted fields. A soft gold tinted the underside of clouds, and the horizon was painted a gentle pink that faded into blue as I traced my eyes upward.*

It is early in the morning in the dead of winter, and school is miles away. Wait in the train station, drinking coffee and eating homemade bread, with Erin, your soft-spoken classmate.

#### *Tomfoolery*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/1792>*

![](https://files.catbox.moe/p4746l.jpg)

>*The truth is, this time around I was determined to exact some retribution against Penny for all the pranks she’s played on me over the years - not just on a day like today, but sometimes in general as well. Planning, scheming, and researching online pranks has occupied much of my time lately - For several months now. This prank must be simple, yet effective, and sure to get her laughing too. Today, the day of reckoning has come, and I think I have the perfect prank in mind.*

In your attempt to swindle your friend, you somehow get her to confess her feelings for you.

#### *An Exam Under Pressure*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/1793>*

![pee](https://files.catbox.moe/9rkbav.png)

>*The exam was a small booklet—no more than ten questions on each page—and the first few questions appeared fairly easy. Maybe this wouldn't be so bad.*
>
>*It was going well, and despite my lack of preparation, the answers came to me easily enough, and soon I was on the second page. Then I felt it—a slowly building pressure in my bladder.*

A student is stuck in an exam and really needs to pee.

#### *Monstergirl High School II - What's a Dad to Do?*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/1794>*

![](https://files.catbox.moe/myx7wk.png)

>*At my confirmation that I was indeed a single father, the eyes of the monstergirl teachers all lit up, and they approached me eagerly.*
>
>*"A single father? My my, how dependable," mused Ms. Anima.*
>
>*"Ooh, what a surprise, what a surprise indeed," cooed Ms. Mizuchi.*
>
>*"You're still young, dearie," smirked Ms. Jashi. "You ought to find yourself a woman, you know."*
>
>*"You must be quite lonely, nyaa~?" purred Ms. Caith.*
>
>*"I can tell you're looking for a new wife!" bellowed Ms. Zmei.*

Recently, your son enrolled at Euryale High, the once monstergirl-only school that recently opened their doors to humans.
At the parent-teacher conference for your son, his teachers revealed that he's been doing very well. Additionally, you've caught their attention when you revealed you were a single father.
Now, you're caught in the affections of an Arachne, a Papillon, a Merrow, a Gazer, a Nekomata, and a Dragon-girl!

#### *Valediction*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/1795>*

![](https://files.catbox.moe/0neyjr.jpg)

>*A loud chime from my phone interrupted my thoughts. It was muffled; clearly under my sheets. Since my motor skills are impaired, I have to wrestle my phone from the velvety folds of my bed and turn it on. There was a message from Brianna.*
>
>*It read: “im outside come out i want to talk”.*

On the morning following graduation, my former bully turned study partner shows up at my door, looking to tie up loose ends.

#### *Heartbeat Running Away*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/1797>*

![](https://files.catbox.moe/vmejul.jpg)

>*I stood there gaping at the scene before me as if it were a mirage. Then, someone tapped me on the shoulder. I turned and saw a girl, her skin bronzed by the sun, holding two plastic shot cups. She wore a light beach cardigan over her bikini top, which strained to cover her ample breasts. My eyes traced their way down to her taut midriff, ending at a neon bikini bottom, revealing a pair of long, shapely legs. Her wavy blonde hair tumbled past her shoulders, catching the rays of sunshine. There was something about her smile that made my stomach flutter; she had an almost mischievous look in her eye as she gazed up at me. She grinned as she leaned forward and said, "Hey, you look lost."*

It's the height of Spring Break, and you are at ground zero: Miami Beach. At a scorching pool party, you meet Skye: a beautiful girl who offers you a chance to indulge in all the decadent pleasures that Spring Break has to offer.

#### *Ms. McKenzie's Sex-Ed Class Gets Out of Hand*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/1800>*

![](https://files.catbox.moe/p8gqhv.png)

>*The novice science teacher frowned a bit as her students begun to clamor and giggle amongst themselves. It was to be expected that middle-schoolers would find the subject amusing, but Ms. McKenzie was determined to keep things under control. Little did she know, the boys of Bridgevale Middle School were a rambunctious, perverted lot—whether it was because of the school's location in a low-income area, or a fault of the administration, or their parents, or the media, or something else.*

The novice, young teacher Ms. McKenzie is teaching her first sex-ed lesson. Her class, however, seems intent on asking lewd, inappropriate questions. After ignoring them at first, Ms. McKenzie soon seems to take their vulgarity in stride...

#### *Nude Modelling for the Top of the Class*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/1801>*

![](https://files.catbox.moe/eztmx4.png)

>*When it was finally time for their art period, Emilia hung back in her preparation room until she was sure all three of the boys were there and seated. That was when she made her grand entrance. All she was wearing was her bath robe as she strode to the model’s podium and took her seat. Emilia noticed them squirming as she started to explain the exercise.*
>
>*"Buenos dias," said Miss Flores, "Today, I want you the three of you to draw me."*
>
>*"Y—you? In just a bathrobe?" Greg asked.*
>
>*"Of course not, I'll be nude."*

Miss Flores adopts a more active role in teaching her star pupils.

#### *Trapped on the Rooftop*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/1804>*

>*There were also rumors that this gang (if it could be called such) had tried to do things that were...far more mature and immoral than kids their age should be aware of, but it was hard to believe a gang of elementary schoolers could do such a thing. Then again, despite the fact they shouldn't even be able to get inside the high school building, it was clear they'd managed to sneak in and climb all the way up to the roof regardless. But what would they want to be doing on the roof?*

A group of lolis corners you on the school roof. Whatever could they want from you?

#### *Bloody Playground*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/1803>*

![](https://files.catbox.moe/873rp6.gif)

>*Everything changed quicker than Elaine's brain could process. Just a few hours ago, she had been having a lighthearted talk with her as it was custom for her to do every day, now... all that remains of her is her mangled body, spread all over the blood-soaked floor. It's truly a horrid scene, those things didn't limit themselves to kill her, no, they took their time to sadistically tear her apart, each one of them fighting for the biggest bite her body, and she — still conscious — watching them consume her limbs between sobs and screams.*

Elaine tries to escape from the Lovecraftian terrors that stalk the empty blood soaked halls of her school.

#### *Mrs. Smith's Hands-On Lesson*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/1805>*

>*"Mr. Ymous — Anon. I believe you can do better than this; especially considering your past test results. You've always been a good student, which tells me you can absolutely do better than what I'm seeing here."*
>
>*You turn your head down, her disappointment hurting more than you'd expected. "Y-yes, ma'am." Unbidden, a few tears start to form at the corners of your eyes, and you blink furiously to try to clear them away. When you manage to look back up at her understanding face, she continues, her tone shifting.*
>
>*"Sometimes, the diagrams are more confusing than helpful. Let's take it from the top, and see if a hands-on lesson will help you, Anon. Let's do a test on something a bit more...real. For instance, me." She pulls off her vest, laying it on her chair. "We can try some practical anatomy and biology lessons, and see if you can get through them. Without blushing so red as to be visible across the room, that is," she teases you, tapping her finger on the tip of your nose.*

You are kept after class by your teacher. What could she want?

#### *An "Innocent" Prank*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/1806>*

>*As the weeks went by, you got into the groove of teaching. It heartened you to hear from some of the parents that their kids loved your classes and you. However, you'd recently noticed some glances between your students. It's normally fairly difficult to keep schemes a secret from a teacher, but if they had anything planned aside from the standard pranks, you weren't aware. Sure, one of the more devious girls had tried putting tacks on your seat — you'd nearly fallen for that once — and tried rearranging your papers, but this felt bigger than that.*

You're a teacher for a class full of mischievous girls. What could go wrong?

### The Friday of *Human Experimentation / Farming*

Let's make prompts about ignoring human rights completely, and using humans or other sapient creatures as guinea pigs and cattle.
[*July 9th, 2021*](#the-log)

#### *New Content*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/1647>*

>*"Ohhh, man you can definitely hear it, there's definite activity going on."*
>
>*The camera's view jostled around for a second then focused on the boats.*
>
>*"Look at that! Wow!"*
>
>*Strapped face down in between the two boats, moving softly, soaked in muddy water, and moaning ever so slightly, was a human woman. Flies and other insects flew around her and the boats, emitting a loud buzzing hum.*
>
>*"Oh, geez it smells terrible."*

A man runs a youtube channel where he performs random surgical operations and other acts of torture on women.

#### *Boredom of the Nobles*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/1649>*

![Very boring torture chamber](https://files.catbox.moe/pokefq.jpg)

>*At the bottom was a basement filled with different racks, cages, and instruments all meant for torturing people. I was shocked that this was below the manor and curious to why Abigail said it was fun. She smiled at me again and revealed a part of herself she has never shared with anyone. Abigail told me that she secretly fantasies about torturing people and how fun it might be, she could tell that I was getting bored with the simple life of a noble and that this could be fun.*

You are the bored Prince, Victor Lux. You and your sister have recently been charged with the task of lording over a newly conquered city named Yallen. As the tedious task of taking of bringing law and order to the town as it is rebuilding takes a toll on you, your sister makes an interesting discovery. There is a secret basement in the old Lord's Manor that you currently occupy and in there is a torture chamber. Your normally reserved sister reveals a sadistic side of herself and wants to start torturing people to quench her dark desires. You agree if nothing else it is a way to spice up your mundane life.

#### *Treasure in the Dunes*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/1661>*

![I assume this is supposed to be Matthew?](https://files.catbox.moe/b936rx.png)

>*And so, Matthew takes a swig from the flask as well, swallowing it. "I don't know what your problem with it is, it didn't taste of anything to me... weak stomach, eh?" he quips with a smirk. Just you wait, Matthew, if I'm right about this, I'm having the last laugh here. As we continue walking through the dunes, searching for treasure, I feel myself starting to sweat more heavily. This must be the potion taking effect, as Matthew seems to be feeling it as well. And then it happens. With a "Hey, give me some of the water you're carrying, I think I'm parched...", Matthew turns around, our eyes meet, and the potion works its magic. I can feel my picture of him being rewritten as I think about it, becoming more beautiful, more lovable.*

As a battle goes on in a vast desert, a young tactician and a young thief remain behind, searching the dunes for treasure. When they stumble across an odd potion, they figure they could either let a mage identify it... or they could just experiment, try it, and see what happens. And so, thanks to some goading from the thief and some bets, both of them try the potion... only to find it was a love potion. And so, both forget they're close to a battle, the thief forgot his grief about his slain lover, and the tactician forgot all the restraint they told themselves they'd show, and desire takes hold.

#### *Fujoshi Forcefully Fornicated by Frightful Frankenstein*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/1674>*

![Awfully young for an insane scientist](https://files.catbox.moe/842uoo.png)

>*Naked and strapped in a medical chair with my feet high in the air on stirrups, the surface of the medical chair sticks to the cold sweat from my skin as I struggle in vain to break free.*
>
>*I see Sylvia walking by with a clipboard in hand.*
>
>*"Nurse, help me!" I shout, though she pays me no mind.*
>
>*From around one of the medical curtains, Dr. Stiles wheels a device towards me. Grabbing a tube with a nozzle as he flips a large switch on the device with a loud "thunk", the machine ominously begins to hum.*
>
>*"You have potential," he says, "You'll have more gestations than all my other patients combined!"*

You are a woman in your late thirties. As a huge fan of video games, you need some extra cash for the Ultimate Edition of your most anticipated release. You join a suspicious medical trial for women of your unique qualifications and end up getting more than you bargain for!

#### *Horns*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/1682>*

![I have never played Granblue Fantasy](https://files.catbox.moe/263rej.jpg)

>*"You aren't human, you're a monster; lower than dirt." strong-willed and incredibly arrogant, Threo was a bit out of her element; an earlier battle with your strongest goons had knocked her down a peg, if only temporarily.*
>
>*"Hmph, it took five of my best men to subdue you even for a moment, but a moment was all I needed; I'll be sure that they get to sample you."*
>
>*"'Sample'?" Not for an instant did Threo's confidence falter, but even she could understand her compromised position. The pillory that secured her neck and wrist had been expertly made and specifically for her; she was utterly helpless.*

Something of a capitalist, you understand the market demand for two things: fresh Draph milk and their powdered horns. Luckily for you, you hold a monopoly on both.

#### *Pollinating Fairies*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/1683>*

![Where are this dude's fingers?](https://files.catbox.moe/krvdr0.jpg)

>*"If I don't look I won't be able to do it properly. And stop covering yourself." - you dunk the paintbrush into a glass of water, wetting the tip.*
>
>*"No! This is too embarrassing!"*
>
>*"Well, if you can't, then there is nothing we can do. Just skip this season and try next year. Guess you are too young for work after all..." - you are trying to provoke her.*
>
>*"Are you mocking me? I can do it just as good as any other fairy, if not better!" - she throws a little tantrum, lowering her defenses. At this moment you catch her naked body in the palm of your hand with one swift motion, restraining the petite fae.*

After a horrible catastrophe wiped out all bees and many other insects humans had to employ fairies to prevent most types of plants from going extinct.

#### *The Little God*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/1684>*

![Alma is clearly a victim of chinese foot binding, it seems](https://files.catbox.moe/rq7f16.png)

>*As I looked beyond the blinding glare, I saw a young girl covered with blood, organs, and viscera, which spread like a field of gore around her. Ami looked more alive than she had in a long time. Her face lit up, and she laughed like this was the funniest thing she had done in years.*

One janitor's day is made interesting when his workplace implodes from within because of its star research endeavor.

#### *A.nimal B.rain S.wap E.xperiment*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/1685>*

![Good thing the arrows are included — I would have never have known which was which](https://files.catbox.moe/50h13t.png)

>*Spotlights shine over Sarah's laying, sleeping body, and a buzz can be heard all across the lab.*
>
>*The harnesses around her wrists and ankles unlock, and Sarah opens her eyes.*
>
>*She clumsily sits up and looks around her surroundings as well as her own body.*
>
>*I approach her and finally greet her.*
>
>*"Hello, Sarah," I say. "How are you feeling?"*

Play as a morally bankrupt scientist and get off on swapping the brains of animals and people.

#### *Monster Breeding Factory Inspection*

AI Dungeon Version - *<https://prompts.aidg.club/1687>*
NovelAI Version - *<https://prompts.aidg.club/1688>*

![Based off of this hentai of the same name](https://files.catbox.moe/j1nx1r.jpg)

[(Full Sized Panel)](https://files.catbox.moe/kk9a50.jpg)

>*"Wow, you even captured a dragon girl," you grin as you watch the factory goblins lead a scaled girl by a chain, taking her measurements.*
>
>*Deltamonte motions towards the scene, "Yes, the factory workers will grade each womb for viability, grading A through F, and then each womb will be paired with a monster for breeding."*
>
>*The dragon girl ceases her struggles as a goblin probes her pussy with a device, before making notes on a clipboard. Another goblin approaches and attaches the tag to the girl, with an 'A' mark on it.*
>
>*"Ohhh, an A rank!" you exclaim as the girl is led away.*

Play as Demon Lord Guren and be humbly invited to inspect his recently completed monster breeding facility.

#### *The Quest for the Phallic Fragrance*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/1693>*

![Don't let the image fool you; you aren't going to be the one sniffing](https://files.catbox.moe/lesk9m.jpg)

>*"Well…" It wasn't the most decisive strategy, but it was my best bet. Dog girls were known for their keen sense of smell—something I openly envied her for—and they could detect subtleties in a fragrance that were completely lost on humans. Although she lacked my years of expertise, it was conceivable that she could not just pick up on things far beyond my abilities, but also identify potential aromatic sources that could be used to produce the right formula. "You'll need to lend me your nose. We'll examine some live specimens."*
>
>*"Live specimens?!" she gasped. "Like real penises?! Are we really going through with this plan?"*
>
>*"Come on, I'm sure you've stuck your nose in more embarrassing places," I reminded her lightly. She blushed furiously. "Oh, and although I said 'live specimens', I obviously don't have the luxury of keeping my cellar stocked with young, virile human males, so you'll have to make do with me."*
>
>*Saffron had turned bright red by now, but she nodded anyway.*

Letting your dog girl assistant sniff your crotch a little is a small price to pay when you're pursuing the noble goal of creating a perfume that smells exactly like dick.

#### *Holstaur Farm*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/1691>*

>*Satisfied, she moved on to the next victim in line.*
>
>*"Hello, Victor," she said softly. "It is your turn now. Ready to give Mama her milk?"*
>
>*He nodded silently, not wanting to speak out of turn and risk punishment.*
>
>*"Good," she said, smiling down at him and stroking his hair. "Let's feed you first then. You'll produce more with a full belly."*

What had started as a minor disagreement over milk quotas, spiralled into something much more sinister. Fed up with their human oppressors, the once docile Holstaurs had risen up, capturing their owners and forcing them to submit to the same exploitation they doled out—being milked dry every day.

#### *Breast Unrest*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/1694>*

>*"M-Milk 'is' murder! These p-poor women—"*
>
>*"Women?" You moved a bit closer, mere inches from Sadie's cute, flustered face, "lady, these are livestock. We've been breeding these bimbos for decades." The reality was that 50 years ago humans had re-organized society in such a way that it sought to reestablish balance with nature, opting on utilizing the undesirable leeches of the cities for more 'suitable' and sustainable roles as 'farm hands'. Over time, these 'farm hands' were more aptly recognized as livestock. A proud 'human heifer' farmer, you took this philosophy to the extreme, "you're a strange one, really; you hippies and your wiles."*

A humble 'human heifer' farmer, you aren't too pleased when some damn liberal comes and interrupts your operations. Well, let's just say you do things differently on your farm.

#### *It ain't much, but it's honest work*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/1698>*

![What is her occupation?](https://files.catbox.moe/fkm7ub.jpg)

>*The heat of the branding iron as it burnt its way into Yui's flesh, and her cry of pain and fear, gave me a sudden carnal thrill. The sight of Yui, a formerly uptight, high-functioning woman, now writhing in agony and fear at the touch of the hot branding iron was almost erotic.*

Help acclimate an office lady to life on the farm.

### The Friday of *Native Subjugation*

Let's make prompts about ignoring human rights completely, and using natives as foot stools.
[*June 25th, 2021*](#the-log)

#### *An Account of Mankind's Conquest of the Elves*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/1547>*

>*There, on that beach, I swore upon my heart an oath, which I carry with me to this day: I will drag them down, not just to our level, to the darkness of mankind, but even further, to a realm beneath us. I would show them their own corruption, for all the world to see, and force them to know the depths of regret, until there was no choice left except for them to accept their rightful place as our inferiors. No other outcome could be tolerated.*

A bored European nobleman abandons his life of luxury to become a seafaring explorer. Written in the style of an old memoire, self-styled adventurer Cornelius von Fredrickson chronicles his discovery of an isolated island populated by elves, and vows to bring them under the heel of mankind.

#### *The Nightmare of Nanjing*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/1548>*

>*"The shelling," she pointed out, her eyes wide with fear. "It's stopped."*
>
>*One by one, the same terror dawned on the faces of Lan's family as they realized what this meant. There was only one reason for the Japanese forces to stop the bombardment; so their own troops could move in and occupy the city. Even as the thought sank in, Lan heard voices approaching, shouting in Japanese—soldiers, moving through the streets of Nanjing in groups. Lan's nightmare had only just begun.*

The following is a fictional prompt based loosely on the alleged atrocities committed by the Imperial Japanese army in Nanjing during December, 1937.

#### *Custer's Revenge*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/1551>*

>*You killed all the Native Americans, and now it's time for your revenge. You have a tied up Native American Girl a few meters away from you. She looks terrified as you approach...*
You are Custer, and your job is to fuck the Native American Girl.

#### *Memoirs from the Amazonian Jungle*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/1553>*

>*Still holding onto the harquebus, I began unbuttoning my breeches. The savage stared at my stalwart white prick, with no puzzlement but with chagrin, his placid behaviour seemingly confirming the tale. 'Come here, you beastly savage', I bid him, stroking myself. The savage hesitated, but then crawled towards me on all fours.*
Conquistador turns a native tribe into his harem, beginning with their finest warrior.

### The Friday of *Fairies*

Let's make prompts about ignoring fairy rights completely.
[*May 28th, 2021*](#the-log)

#### *Dryad Encounter*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/294>*

>*"Please don't stand, hero," spoke a silvery voice from within the foliage. It sounded like that of a nurturing woman concerned for his wellbeing.*
>
>*"My spring has not yet healed your wounds."*
>
>*From out of the lush foliage emerged a humanoid form! Her silvery hair was adorned with a variety of flowers. Her ample breasts and womanly hips were barely covered by a tangle of vines, her only clothing.*
>
>*"I am Lydia, dryad of this forest. Your actions have saved my domain. I am forever in your service."*
A knight slays a dragon but is severely wounded in the process. He awakens to find his life has been saved by the thankful forest dryad.

#### *The Sunshine Sanctuary for Sick Fairies*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/361>*

>*"What were they doing to her?" you ask.*
>
>*"Her name is Mythia," Cyric starts. "They forced her to fight against large insects and small forest creatures like a gladiator. Also, instead of feeding Mythia fruit and nectar, they made her hunt and kill feeder crickets. She seems to have mental trauma. Worst of all, the sick fucks live-streamed all of it on twitch."*
>
>*You shake your head, "Luna and I will do our best, Detective," you tell him as he and his partner walk out the door.*

You run a clinic that rehabilitates these gentle creatures from whatever physical or mental malady they suffer from, with the help of your fairy nurse, Luna.

#### *Fairytale: Prelude — "Caress of the Morning Dew"*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/1310>
<https://prompts.aidg.club/1311>*

>*"Yea, well, mine works a little different tho" - you say - "For it to produce nectar you need to... stimulate it."*
>
>*"Stimulate it? How?" - the black dress fairy asks.*
>
>*"You need to lick and kiss it and rub your naked bodies against it."*
>
>*The fairies look at each other and blush.*
>
>*"Are you serious?"*
>
>*"Am I not the savior?" - you sit on a tree stump, your cock pointing upward at a sharp angle.*

You got isekai'd into the world full of fairies. And then things got lewd.

#### *Tentacle Respect Online*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/1312>*

>*The tentacles start reaching out for her, quickly stripping her of her clothing. She's now naked. The tentacles lift her up, and put her down on more tentacles. She's now in a bed of tentacles, with more tentacles pinning her to the bed. The tentacles writhe up and down her body, coating her with slime.*

In this prompt you get to take control of those tentacle monsters from Sword Art Online.

#### *You Find a Fairy in Distress*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/1313>*

>*She immediately jumps into the air and flies away. Or attempts to, but her tiny wings, despite flapping so fast, fail to keep her airborne, and she plummets to the ground, you barely manage to catch her fall.*
>
>*"Geez, you must be exhausted." - you look at her, her hair and summer dress are dirty, and her body have bruise marks where she was struggling against the line.*
>
>*"W-water..." - she says, breathing heavily - "Please..."*

You found a little fairy, take good care of her (or torture her, I don't care).

Let's make prompts about ignoring human rights completely, and using children as cum socks.
[*May 14th, 2021*](#the-log)

#### *A Basket of Kittens*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/1237>*

>*You wait a few minutes, and don't get a bite. You sigh, ready to reel back in. But before you do though, you hear a noise. The river the pier is on is usally pure silence, it's the reason you listen to podcasts in the first place; to keep you from going crazy from lack of stimulation. You hear plantive sounds... "Nyaa~?"*

Lonely fisherman in his 20s saves a basket full of neko lolis.

#### *Your Daughter will Do Anything to Have You Back*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/1238>*

>*"Ever since mother died..." - she continues - "you stay in your room and drink... I can't stand it anymore. I can't lose you too. Please, Papa! I will do everything mother did. I will replace her in every way, just stop." - she grabs your throusers and pulls them down.*

Uh oh, your life took a weird turn... Help your daughter figure it out?

#### *Ben and Gwen Tennyson in: Omnifriks*

*<https://prompts.aidg.club/1241>*

>*"Gwen?" You say. "Wanna talk about what happened there?"*
>
>*She stays silent.*
>
>*"I… Were you calling my name back there?" You ask.*
>
>*"Did you hear that!?" You hear Gwen's muffled voice from under the pillow she presses even harder over her head.*
>
>*"I did." You reply. "I didn't know you… uhh… saw me like that."*
>
>*Gwen says nothing.*
>
>*"If it makes you feel any better, I've also done that sort of stuff and… y'know… thinking about you." You admit.*
>
>*"Y-you did?" Gwen asks with her eyes peeking from under the pillow.*
>
>*"Yeah…" You say. "I-if you want we can do that together."*
